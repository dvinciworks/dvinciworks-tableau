<p>So let’s fast forward the early bits. Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, worked for Fidelity Investments as an out of uni job blah blah. Then things started to get a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>I started a fledgling engineering business which quickly warped and twisted its way into a games console repair company. Fun. Anyone who has started a first business will know that you spend the first year just finding your feet. Learning about regulations you’ve never heard of before, wondering where the next day’s work is going to come from. I think it takes most people that long just to pop their heads up out the fog and take a look around and for me this was the point where I really started enjoying myself.</p>
<p>We had probably 6 or so employees, 5 repairers and a Quality Control/warehouse guy by this point. Even then I recognised the benefit to giving back the right information and feedback to staff as near to real time as possible. I had designed a simple data base and logging system and was using excel to query it a graph out the productivity. Nothing gave incentive to accurately log the repair like seeing your little bar in the chart jump above the guy next to you. At this point in the business it wasn’t even financially incentivised just good positive (quick) feedback. And that was the key.</p>
<p>The business doubled in size year on year and our graphing nudged its way into other areas of the business. Trying to get info out of emails we were receiving, desperately trying to get something better than the standard reporting out of SAGE Line 50 Accounts (reach out to me if you want to hear more about InterWorks solution with SAGE). With a workforce of 70+ we were spending a lot of time on it and had to come up with better quicker solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Access tables turned into SQL tables. Access forms turned into .NET. Excel graphs turned into Tableau Dashboards. Sold!</strong></p>
<p>From that point on Tableau has formed a big part of my life. For the remainder of the lifecycle of that business through to becoming a BI consultant and Tableau Trainer with InterWorks. I’m still using it and still enjoying using it.</p>
<p>So what now? Helping as many people as I can understand that access and insights to data matters. It’s not just for the CEO, not just for directors and managers but for everyone doing every job within an organisation. To even attempt this you have to have a tool which a lot of people can use and you have to open up the available data to many many more people.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.caravanclub.co.uk/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11440 aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/caraclub.jpg" alt="caraclub" width="408" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>Established in 1907, the Caravan Club was founded by ten men and one woman and is one of the few organisations that has maintained its same titles and goals since it first opened its doors. Now, over a hundred years later, the Caravan Club is the largest caravanning organisation in Europe.  With over 3,000 sites, accommodating 200,000 people every single day, it provides over 20 million bed nights per annum; more than any other major hotel chain.</p>
<p>When thinking about data, you can imagine 108 years building up to quite a significant amount. The Club was having difficulties uncovering the true potential of this data and, realising there had been significant developments in Business Analytics tooling, they found Tableau and wanted to gain business benefits by leveraging the software.</p>
<p>We recently met with John Quinlan, Business Analytics Manager, from the Caravan Club to find out how they’ve found Tableau:</p>
<p><strong>Hi John, would you mind telling us, what was your Business Problem or what were you trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>Sure! Essentially, the Club had an ageing SAP BW Installation, which had a limited scope of data in it. This wasn&#8217;t the easiest to develop in, and was costly to maintain. We also realised there had been significant developments in Business Analytics tooling and wanted to gain business benefit by leveraging these.</p>
<p><strong>Was there a driving factor in looking for a solution? </strong></p>
<p>The key driving factor in looking for another solution was that the Club wanted to migrate to a Business-led self-service BI organisational model. The existing SAP BW platform was complex and costly to maintain and only IS staff could perform report development. There were no real graphical capabilities; everything was exported to Excel and performed there.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you end up choosing InterWorks?</strong></p>
<p>InterWorks were the largest Tableau European Systems Integrator that we could find. There was a Vendor selection process evaluating systems integrators and products and InterWorks produced by far the best presentation and capabilities display.</p>
<p><strong>What was the InterWorks Solution?</strong></p>
<p>The Interworks options presented were discussed as to the best route for the Club. Initially it was decided to start with a “per user” approach to the licensing. This gave us the flexibility within the Club to roll out in a phased approach.</p>
<p><strong>How was the solution implemented?</strong></p>
<p>The solution implemented was led by a contracted project manager on behalf of the Club. They worked with our internal staff, InterWorks and the PM to refine the final architecture design and then implement it. InterWorks&#8217; experience in key areas such as installation of Tableau Server and initial report development, along with technical training was a significant benefit and one of the main reasons we chose them.</p>
<p><strong>What were the results?</strong></p>
<p>The results have delivered a trusted, stable solution with trained users and IS team members supporting where needed. The system is well liked and we have had to purchase more user licenses as the popularity continues to grow. New insights have been derived and many processes that took hours or days now can be performed in a matter of a few clicks.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of the key benefits the solutions provided?</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of having a system which is now a trusted single source of truth across the business has reduced the amount of reconciliation and disagreement between departments as to what the correct figures are, insights into behaviour from data spanning several sources is now possible and all this can be done by users and power users in the organisation resulting in a significantly lighter load on the IS resources and removing that bottleneck.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for the Caravan Club?</strong></p>
<p>The Club are now looking at further expansion of data and deeper integration with their Digital Engagement Platform to help drive decisions on campaign management and produce an all-inclusive single view of the customer.</p>
<p>We’re hoping the Caravan Club will continue to benefit from the many benefits Tableau brings and we’ll always be on hand to help, whenever needed.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started my career as an electrical engineer graduating from the University of Southampton. I enjoyed engineering and the problem solving challenges it frequently provided but it wasn’t until I started running my own businesses that I discovered a wider version of problem solving.<br />
My second business ‘Total Console Repair’ was the point at which I really discovered Business Intelligence. I didn’t know I‘d discovered Business Intelligence, but I had.</p>
<p><strong>Total Console Repair</strong><br />
Total Console Repair Limited was a company which fixed consumer electronics, by the truck load. In order to service our large corporate clients and handle the vast quantities of units we needed to have a large number of repair technicians. Initially we used traditional management methods to monitor and get the most from our staff but we soon found a better way. We started setting Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) that the technicians could be compared against: Number of repairs, Ratio of repaired / failed, Warranty returns etc etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rob-PS3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10139" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rob-PS3-300x228.jpg" alt="Rob PS3" width="300" height="228" /></a></p>
<p>For the first few years we dashboarded all of this in Excel which pulled data from our Access database. I spent a lot of time and became a master of Excel. Typically a dashboard would take up to 10 days to create and often would require a full rebuild whenever we wanted to add a new measure. Imagine my delight when I was introduced to Tableau v4.0 by none other than our fearless leader at InterWorks Europe, Mel Stephenson. Suddenly I could create a dashboard in under a day and make modifications in minutes. As our business grew at an alarming rate we upgraded to MS SQL server and Tableau seamlessly accommodated the change in technology and business process.<br />
We started rolling out dashboards to other areas of the business. Call centre, Finance, Management, Sales. ISO 9000 accreditation said that each job role must be defined but we went a step further than that and gave each job role a dashboard which not only defined the important tasks but measured each staff member against their KPIs in real time.<br />
Sadly the recession hit the UK, most of our customers went in to administration and we had to shut down Total Console Repair. During the 18 month wind down period Tableau came in to its own again. We were able to vastly change the way we worked and alter business processes to combine job roles.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br />
After Total Console Repair ceased trading I couldn’t think of anything I would prefer to do than to advise and implement best use of Tableau within other organisations. I had become passionate about BI best practice; which is really Jargon for ‘making your job easier and more productive’. It’s not all about data; it’s about people and giving them the right information in the right way. A happy, stress-free workforce is a productive workforce.</p>

<p><strong>InterWorks</strong><br />
I was involved with InterWorks EU from the early days and it was a natural choice for me to join the team. I love working with Tableau every day and I also love the positive impact which can be created from implementing sound BI for clients. A good dashboard is like opening a window in to an otherwise black box. With enough well designed dashboards you can turn your company in to a transparent box with every aspect being visible to all.</p>
