				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>T-Minus 2 Days&#8230; (probably less if you read this before I update this countdown again!)</p>
<p>The Training Camps are almost complete and the tapering down is in progress&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Weigh-In is just around the corner which marks the Grand Finale in terms of preparations before the Main Event itself &#8211; &#8220;The Fight of the Century&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Click to open in new window" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/alastair.young#!/vizhome/MayweatherVsPacquiao-PathstotheFightoftheCentury/FightoftheCentury" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12261" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fight-of-the-Century-1024x812.png" alt="Fight of the Century" width="904" height="717" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">(Please click on the picture above to take you through to the live Dashboard hosted on Tableau Public)</h6>
<p>For 6+ years, boxing fans from across the globe have waited for this fight to happen. The endless and tedious, &#8216;Will-they Won&#8217;t-they&#8217; conundrum rattled on and on, far longer than anyone expected, and far longer than it ever should have. New discussions, new demands, purse agreements, drug testing, fight weight, glove weight&#8230;. All topics that in one way or another contributed to the fight not happening until now. With all this, the title of &#8216;The Best Pound-for-Pound Fighter in the World&#8217; is about to be decided either way and just to make it a little more interesting, let&#8217;s throw in the estimated $350 million in revenue it is likely to generate. It&#8217;s now quite easy to see why everyone is dubbing this &#8216;The Fight of the Century&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whoever wins &#8211; this has been the most hyped boxing match in recent years and rightly so. Neither fighter needs the money&#8230; but boxing as a sport needs this more than anything. Gone are days of the regular Big Fight Weekends.</p>
<p>Nothing will surprise its audience (apart from those at ringside whose pockets must feel considerably lighter). We all know each fighter&#8217;s capabilities, and are intrigued about both of their tactics going into the spectacle. Everyone has their favourite&#8230; it&#8217;s now just a case of who will WIN?</p>
<p>Mayweather is the supreme fighter with an unblemished professional record of 47-0-0 but&#8230; can he cope with Pacquiao&#8217;s speed? Can he take Pacquiao&#8217;s volume of punches? Can he continue to deal with the pressure of an undefeated record and the possibility of hitting the mat? &#8211; And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>Pacquiao in his own right is a phenomenal fighter. A sanctioned World Champion over 6 weight divisions throughout his career, but with some blemishes on 57-5-2 record. Have past defeats made him a better fighter? Can he play the long game against Mayweather? Can his speed and stance cause Mayweather to crumble? And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>With Mayweather currently favourite at odds of 1/2 and Pacquiao at odds of 2/1 to win outright, this is the closest and best odds for a Mayweather fight in recent years. Looking at the odds for an early stoppage (KO,TKO or DQ), Pacquiao is now favourite at 5/1 vs Mayweather at 13/2. This all may sound weird but this directly correlates to each of the fighter&#8217;s careers and how they have won their previous bouts. Mayweather stays for the long game but for Pacquiao it&#8217;s all about the knockouts.</p>
<p>Further information on each of the fighter&#8217;s professional careers can be found on the visualisation above. It provides historical fight data and statistics for each fighter in preparation for this weekend&#8217;s showdown. No matter what happens, it&#8217;s likely to be an amazing spectacle and hope it can live up to all its expectations.</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, I would love to see Manny Pacquiao knock out Floyd Mayweather &#8230;&#8230; underdogs can still win (remember Rahman beating Lennox Lewis!?)</p>
