<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tableau&#8217;s sample files wouldn&#8217;t look so good if they weren&#8217;t well designed</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/113372014271548958684/posts">Alistair Knock</a> posted a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109667890964357276732/posts/T8upC8GDuhg">great question by Moose Peterson</a> on Google+  about feedback on user photographs on the web:why do most people just make anodyne comments along the lines of “Nice!” when they probably have some constructive criticism they are holding back?</p>
<p>This got me thinking. How do I respond to seeing Tableau Public workbooks?</p>
<p>The more I use Tableau Public, the higher and higher I believe the bar has to be set for a successful Tableau Public visualisation. You <em>must</em> think like a web designer when publishing to Tableau Public. Layout, fonts, interactivity, colour, etc: these consume vast tracts of web designers’ time for a reason. Just as a badly designed web page is a disastrous advert for your brand, so too is a weak Tableau Public viz. I’ll be exploring these issues in more detail in my session, “Expose yourself with Tableau Public”, at the Tableau Customer Conference in Las Vegas in October.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tweetpraise.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2723 alignnone" title="tweetpraise" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tweetpraise.png" alt="" width="400" height="160" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">An anodyne retweet of my own</span></strong></p>
<p>What is my own reaction to seeing Tableau Public visualisations? If I like it, I’ll comment on the blog, or <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/acotgreave/status/91055533209042944">tweet it</a>. Good work deserves to be praised. What about my critical thoughts? Believe me, I see areas for improvement in almost all the visualisations I see; some recent popular Tableau Public vizzes by well known members of the Tableau community have been, in my opinion, really badly designed. Have I told them? No.</p>
<p>If I think your workbook needs redesigning or tweaking, generally, I say nothing. Why is that?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because I appreciate effort – at least the author is using Tableau, and having a go. I wouldn’t want them to stop that. I think most authors just want to get their data out there. They aren’t interested in someone they probably don’t know dissing what might have taken them hours to create.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because I question my own opinions: on whose authority am I an expert in Tableau Public? What if my opinions are wrong? I don’t get much criticism of my own work; I get almost universal praise. This is brilliant, but what if everyone else is also just hiding their critical thoughts about what I do? I <em>think</em> I’m pretty good at this Tableau-data-viz thing (actually, I’m <em>quite confident</em> I am good at it), but I don’t <em>know for sure</em>. <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/">Stephen Few</a> is famous for his approach of calling things exactly as he sees them. If he has a problem with your work, he’ll share that with you and with the world, and justify those opinions. As a result he is widely read and widely respected. He has also stimulated many great debates as both his supporters and detractors explore the issues he raises.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because I’m not sure I can express my opinions in a constructive manner. Stephen Few writes excellently, justifying his opinions. I am not sure I can critique well enough to cause the author to reflect rather than get angry.</p>
<p>Reading through the many thoughtful comments on Moose Peterson’s G+ post, I think I should rethink my approach.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you be comfortable critiquing others’ Tableau Public workbooks? Would you behave differently on the internet as you do face-to-face? Would your freedom to critique others change when you become a Tableau employee (as I will be in 6 weeks)? How would you react if I started saying &#8220;nice viz, but your dashboard layout&#8217;s all wrong&#8221;?</p>
