				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have to make an important business trip that involves driving through heavy traffic. You jump into your brand new company car ready to set off, only to discover things are not what you expected. There is no steering wheel in front of you. The familiar pedals have gone too. In their place are some strange buttons and a small screen that can only display four letters. The traffic around you is building up and it&#8217;s time to get moving. Ready?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UCD-Interior-2-626x421.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10667" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UCD-Interior-2-626x421-300x201.jpg" alt="UCD-Interior-2-626x421" width="500" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>As a product manager back in the early 80&#8217;s I used to tell this story to illustrate the huge impact that new digital technology was having on the technicians who depended on their industrial measuring instruments to manage their production processes. Gone were the familiar switches and knobs. In their place, tortuous menus and confusing messages. Faced with the daily telephone calls from users struggling to ge their heads round all this new functionality I realised there had to be a better way to operate this technology and started to experiment. Making the complex simple proved to be a winning formula for this product line, and it&#8217;s a passion that guides me to this day.</p>
<p>It was exciting to be driving a new technology and good for my career too. As I began to work more closely with the commercial managers I was puzzled at first to find they did not really seem to share my enthusiasm for these wonderful products. Then I was hit by a blinding flash of the obvious. What they wanted to know is how this would help them reach their sales goals. I had to adjust my focus and start talking about the things that would help them achieve success. That was another key insight that sits deep.</p>
<p>My first experience to carry full P&amp;L responsibility for an organisation was a baptism by fire. I was asked to clean up the mess left by two failed General Managers before me just as Europe headed into a period of recession. Tough decisions were inevitable and I needed dependable data to help guide me. It was challenging to get all the insights that I needed and that&#8217;s when I really discovered the true loneliness of leadership and realised that each discipline within an organisation has its own unique language and way of thinking.</p>
<p>Hard work and enthusiasm are key to success, but not enough on their own. To reach the top of your game you really need good teamwork. Just like in sports that means each player needs to know what the game is and understand the rules. When I was given an the opportunity to build a new pan European operation for a manufacturer of infrared thermal systems I found we always performed best when we had good processes in place, supported with metrics that the teams owned.</p>
<p>In subsequent roles I continued to work on good processes, extending from services and operations into the more challenging areas of salesforce management. I found it hugely rewarding to see directly how the efforts of our teams were directly driving the sales successes. We found ways to track the take up of new offerings from the earliest introductions to customers, through lead generation and all the way along the pipeline to order conversion. My focus moved more and more into development of the metrics and tools &#8211; mainly using excel where I had to get my teeth into macro programming to achieve what I we needed.</p>
<p>My last role in the process automation field involved setting up a new service to help food producers optimise the operation of their production plant. As part of this I needed a way to display key metrics in an online portal. It was during this period I first worked with the team from Interworks and was introduced to Tableau. I fell in love with Tableau. How it took data and made it beautiful but moreover gave it meaning. Meaning that could be used to make decisions rather than the time spent pouring over numbers and a decision hurriedly being made on a best guess.</p>
<p>Working with InterWorks was an effortless experience. I was impressed by their professionalism and enthusiasm throughout the project, so much so that I joined their ranks in October 2013. Since then I have become the companies 7th Accredited Trainer, delivered training all over Europe and India and had the pleasure of working with a broad range of clients providing consultancy and proof of concepts. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed helping people professionally. To impart knowledge and see that person hit their potential is a great feeling. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m a flying instructor in my free time and why InterWorks is the best place I can imagine being.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, drawing some circular inspiration from the front cover of David McCandless&#8217; <em>Information Is Beautiful</em>, I&#8217;m going to take a simple bar chart and wrap it around a circle, for no other reason than to see if it can be done in Tableau. You can argue amongst yourselves as to whether this is a good/meaningful visualisation, but it&#8217;s a pretty little thing and has a few nice tricks in it so read it for its educational value rather than an integral part of your next client&#8217;s dashboard.</p>
<p><span id="more-9389"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Chart<br />
</strong><br />
We&#8217;re going to end up with something a bit like this. The finished visualisation is at the end of the post, complete with a few parameters to let you alter the appearance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/radial-graphic.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview<br />
</strong></p>
<p>We will be using Tableau&#8217;s line drawing capabilities to draw our graph, so we will need two points for each bar, one positioned on an inner circle and one extending outwards along the same angle. Once we&#8217;ve worked out an angle for each of our bars we just dig out some school geometry to break that down into an X,Y plot and we&#8217;re pretty much done.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121913_1334_Itsyourroun1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Drawing the green bar requires us to know the two radii and the angle on which the bar is projected.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: The Data</strong></p>
<p>Normally on a scatter plot you are only plotting individual marks, so you have one row of data per point. However we need two points to define the line so we need to do a bit of work on the data connection. To do this we will use a UNION query to create a second version of the data. In order to keep the field calculations the same the second query will have a few strategically placed zeroes and will introduce a field called PathOrder which will be either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether it represents the start or the end of our lines. We will be using a cut down set of fields from the Sample Superstore (Subset) data source that comes with Tableau.</p>
<p>Connect to the Superstore Sales Subset excel spreadsheet and then use a Custom SQL connection as follows:</p>
<p><code>SELECT [Orders$].[Product Category] AS [Category],<br />
[Orders$].[Product Name] AS [Item],<br />
[Orders$].[Profit] AS [Profit],<br />
[Orders$].[Row ID] AS [Row ID],<br />
[Orders$].[Sales] AS [Sales],<br />
1 AS PathOrder<br />
FROM [Orders$]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT [Orders$].[Product Category] AS [Category],<br />
[Orders$].[Product Name] AS [Item],<br />
0 AS [Profit],<br />
[Orders$].[Row ID] AS [Row ID],<br />
0 AS [Sales],<br />
0 AS PathOrder<br />
FROM [Orders$]</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Table Calcs for Angles and Lengths<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The first thing we are going to do is to work out the angle for each bar, and then work out a normalised length for each bar. We used a normalised length to make it easier to specify the size of the internal circle and allow us to fix our axes on the final chart. For the angle we should know that there are <em>2π</em> radians in a full circle (360 degrees if that&#8217;s your thing). For the normalised length we are going to make the outer circle radius for the largest bar in the dataset equal to 1, so that means that each bar is going to be a fraction of the length between the two circles i.e. r2-r1</p>
<p>In my worksheet I am going to make the size of the internal circle a parameter called RADIAL_INNER set to 0.2 and the outer circle for the largest bar will be set to 1. I&#8217;m from a coding background though and don&#8217;t like &#8220;magic numbers&#8221; in code, so I&#8217;ll use a parameter called RADIAL_OUTER and set that to 1. With good naming conventions you can often get code to self-comment, and it gives you more flexibility if you ever wanted to change the value later.</p>
<p>Here are the calculated fields we need to create<br />
<code><br />
RADIAL_FIELD:<br />
[Sales]</code></p>
<p>RADIAL_ANGLE:<br />
(INDEX()-1) * (1/WINDOW_COUNT(COUNT([RADIAL_FIELD]))) * 2 * PI()</p>
<p>RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH:<br />
[RADIAL_INNER]<br />
+ IIF(ATTR([PathOrder]) = 0 , 0 ,<br />
SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])/WINDOW_MAX(SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])) * ([RADIAL_OUTER]-[RADIAL_INNER]))</p>
<p>RADIAL_X<br />
[RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH] * COS([RADIAL_ANGLE])</p>
<p>RADIAL_Y<br />
[RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH] * SIN([RADIAL_ANGLE])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Plotting the Cartesian Coordinates<br />
</strong></p>
<p>We are going to have our chart sorted by Category and then by Item so we need to create a combined field. Click Category then Ctrl+Click Item and right-click and select Combine Fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add RADIAL_X to Columns</li>
<li>Add RADIAL_Y to Rows</li>
<li>Select Line as the mark type on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add Category to Colour on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add our Combined Category&amp;Item field to Detail on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add PathOrder to Path on the Marks card</li>
<li>For RADIAL_X and RADIAL_Y set the table calc to Compute By Category&amp;Item</li>
<li>Edit each axis so that its range is fixed from -1 to 1</li>
<li>Format grid lines and axes as you wish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Labelling and Parameters<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Now we have our chart, the values are not as useful to the user as they have been normalised to help us set the inner circle, so we need the field labels on there (both on the chart and on the tooltips). If you drag the RADIAL_FIELD to Label on the marks card you will see that some labels for the 0 points appear inside the circle, to stop this from happening we create a calculated field that only shows labels above a certain threshold, which I will add using a parameter so it can be changed on dashboards as well as making the table calc self-comment<br />
<code><br />
RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL:<br />
IIF(SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])&gt;[RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL_THRESHOLD], SUM([RADIAL_FIELD]), NULL)<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now all we need to do is put it on a dashboard and set up our parameters to let the user customise the graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the RADIAL_INNER parameter to have a Range of Allowable values from 0 to 1 step 0.1</li>
<li>Set the RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL_THRESHOLD to 100000</li>
<li>Create a parameter RADIAL_FIELD_USE with available values &#8216;SALES&#8217;, &#8216;PROFIT&#8217;</li>
<li>Edit the RADIAL_FIELD calc to:<br />
<code>CASE [RADIAL_FIELD_USE] WHEN "Sales" THEN [Sales] WHEN "Profit" THEN [Profit] END</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Whilst it may not be the most informative of views it is a good example of how you can make Tableau draw visualisations that are a little out of the ordinary. Like I said at the beginning, sometimes you do things just to see if you can, so here&#8217;s the viz to prove it can be done! Hope you enjoyed the post, feel free to leave comments / ask questions below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been much interesting debate about David McCandless’ <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information Is Beautiful</a> this week, initiated by a <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=935">well written critical piece</a> by Stephen Few. I am pleased he has challenged the orthodox view that McCandless is the answer to the data visualisation industry’s problems.</p>
<p>On both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140825034122/http://flowingdata.com:80/2011/04/17/business-intelligence-vs-infotainment/">FlowingData</a> and Stephen’s own blog, there is debate about the difference between “simple” and “simplistic” graphics. This is a hard point to describe, and there are two comments on Stephen’s blog (by DR, and Stephen himself) that made me realise that a picture would emphasise the difference. I wondered how McCandless, if the accusation of simplicity is correct, would rework what&#8217;s often claimed to be one of the greatest data visualisations.</p>
<p>Consider the classic work by Charles Minard showing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia_%281812%29">Napoleon’s disastrous 1812 march on Moscow</a>. This graphic, I believe, fits Stephen’s definition of simple. Sure, there are many dimensions being displayed (soldier numbers, temperature, location, etc) but once the viewer understands that, the powerful anti-war message is unavoidable. The waste of life is brutally clear and well contextualised by the time location and temperature:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png" alt="Minard's march on Moscow (from Wikipedia)" width="640" height="305" /></a>#</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">(image from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png)</span></a></p>
<p>If McCandless is to be accused of simplicity, how might a simplistic version look? I think it would be like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/minardSimplified2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2311" title="minardSimplified" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/minardSimplified2.png" alt="" width="500" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Why? The simplistic approach tries to strip away as much data as it can. Minard’s main point was the loss of life. The version above shows just that and no more. One could argue that therefore it is more effective. But it isn’t. Minard’s simple graph gives much more context without any fluff and that, to me, is the difference between “simple” and “simplistic”.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Fixed the spelling of David McCandless&#8217; name &#8211; sorry about the typos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One can always expect visually attractive stuff from David McCandless on his Information is Beautiful blog. Sometimes though, the visual displays potentially confuse viewers. <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/the-science-behind-wikipedias-jimmy-appeal/">Today&#8217;s great post on Wikipedia Banner Tests</a> is an example. Representing the size of donations using a square is pretty, for sure. However, we tend to perceive the relationship of one area to another pretty badly. A linear representation is more effective:</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script><object class="tableauViz" width="594" height="815" style="display:none;"><param name="name" value="Wikpediaappeals/Wikipediabanners" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /><param name="tabs" value="yes" /></object><noscript>Wikipedia banner testsThe effectiveness of donation appeals on Wikipedia <br /><a href="#"><img alt="Wikipedia banner testsThe effectiveness of donation appeals on Wikipedia " src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Wi/Wikpediaappeals/Wikipediabanners/1_rss.png" height="100%" /></a></noscript></p>
<div style="width:594px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px; color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Wikpediaappeals/Wikipediabanners" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>Think back to David&#8217;s orginal squares view &#8211; would you really have guessed that the Jimmy Appeal raised <strong>fifteen</strong> times much cash? If so, you&#8217;re one of the few &#8211; most people would have said it was around 8-10 times larger. The linear view above makes that difference much more clear.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also some interactivity on my view &#8211; you can change the measures being displayed in order to explore the data a little more.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a chart doing the rounds that shows who is suing whom in the telecoms industries (eg <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/04/microsoft-motorola-android-patent-lawsuit">at the Guardian</a>). <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/whos-suing-whom-in-the-telecoms-trade/">David McCandelish has improved it nicely here</a>, and asked the question of whether companies who’s revenue is going down are more litigious than those on the rise. Well, I took his data from here and created the charts below.</p>

" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Whossuingwho-MobilephonecompaniesWhossuingwho_rss.png" height="100%" /></a></noscript>
<div style="width:544px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px; color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Whossuingwho/MobilephonecompaniesWhossuingwho" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>

<p>There are lots of caveats: I excluded Smartphone Technologiess LLC because the data didn’t say if their revenue was up or down. That’s a shame, because they’ve got the most lawsuits open. Also, we don’t know if the revenue was going up or down when the lawsuit was started.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; for Tableau geeks, the tooltips on the chart are using my <a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/blog/the-data-studio-blog/andy-cotgreave/tableau-tooltips-conditional-formatting">Conditional Formatting trick (click here)</a> to make the text colour change depending upon Revenue Direction.</p>
