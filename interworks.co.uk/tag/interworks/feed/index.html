				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s getting ever closer to the biggest Tableau Event of the year &#8211; the Tableau Conference on Tour. This year Tableau will be hitting Singapore, London, Berlin and Melbourne, showing the world truly how great Tableau is.</p>
<h2><b>When and Where Will the Tour Take Place?</b></h2>
<p>The European leg of the tour is set for various dates between June and July. We&#8217;re excited to be sponsoring both Berlin and London:</p>
<p>8 &#8211; 10 June, 2015 | Berlin, DE</p>
<p>6-8 July, 2015 | London, UK</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="http://ontour15.tableau.com/">official Tableau Conference on Tour website.</a></p>
<p>Not able to make it? The Tableau Conference on Tour isn’t the only opportunity to see Tableau and InterWorks in action. There&#8217;ll be plenty of other opportunities. InterWorks are also holding a Tableau inspired event in London, on 28th May so if you&#8217;d like to get involved in that, click <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/conversion-thursday-may-tickets-16751884337">here</a> for more info.</p>
<h2><b>InterWorks Proud to be a Sponsor</b></h2>
<p>As a leading Tableau Gold Partner, we’re carrying on our tradition of sponsorship for yet another year. This means much more to us than buying a bit of advertising. It means we’ll be well represented at each event stop, standing ready to share our wealth of Tableau wisdom with attendees. We&#8217;re excited about hearing all the exciting things people are doing with their data. We also have a few surprises of our own to share, so make sure you pop to our stand to find out more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently held a webinar on how InterWorks could help em&#8217;power&#8217; your Tableau Experience, using the InterWorks <a href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/">Power Tools for Tableau</a>. If you wanted a recap or fancy finding out exactly what could possibly make Tableau even better, read on&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you have a successful Tableau environment with plenty of awesome content but now you need a way to manage all of that great content? During the webinar, we showed how the InterWorks Workbook Tools for Tableau, the ultimate productivity suite for managing your Tableau content, can help you and your users get the very best from your Tableau content by helping you with styling, performance, best practice, auditing, merging and deploying between Tableau environments.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-RO0nO-1Js" width="650" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
<b>Don’t want to watch the whole webinar?<br />
</b><i>Click on a section title to jump straight to the part that’s relevant to you:</i></p>
<p><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=210">Style Management<br />
</a>For when you have a selection of workbooks and you’d like to ensure that they all follow a consistent look and feel or your corporate style guide, but you don’t want to spend a week (or more!) adjusting each element individually.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=604">Merge function<br />
</a>Do you collaborate with others and then want to merge workbooks, or take the best elements of some existing workbooks to make one new workbook containing just those?</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=924">Data Source Audit Tool<br />
</a>‘We’ve just changed these items in the database. Hope that’s OK”. If you’ve ever had that and would like to know instantly what effect that will have on any workbook in your entire Tableau library, this is for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=1173">Best Practice Analyzer<br />
</a>How would you like some advice on best practice for one or all of your dashboards &#8211; the equivalent of having the whole InterWorks team looking at every component of your dashboards along with guidance on why they are best practice and how to address them?</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=1456">Performance Analyzer<br />
</a>See InterWorks’ real-time, detailed, in-memory Tableau performance profiling tool in action and how it can help you understand what are the key changes you can make to any dashboard to deliver an improved experience to your users.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/j-RO0nO-1Js?t=1848">Enterprise Deployment Tool<br />
</a>Successful Tableau implementations often allow for users to have a safe playground (a dev area) along with a governed, approved environment (production) and often an environment in between such as UAT or Pre-Production. If you would like to know how to deploy workbooks between your Tableau Server environments with changes in connections, a scheduled approvals process, archiving and version control or would like to know how to ensure that there are no Tableau workbooks in production using dev data, watch this section.</p>

<p>It’s 24 days to go until the biggest Tableau event in Europe &#8211; <a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London</a>. If you’re a seasoned conference veteran you’ll know these events are huge. And this year is special because it was the first time the European event was split into three &#8211; The Hague, Munich and London. This gave the European Tableau community even more opportunity to share in the fun, the learning and the energy.</p>
<p>It’s by far the biggest and best opportunity for the Tableau community to come together to share their ideas, learn new ways of getting the very best from Tableau and enjoy all the fun that comes from being part of the most vibrant data analytics community in the world. There’s so much to do at the conferences it’s impossible not to come away feeling energised and brimming with new ideas of how to better implement Tableau in your role, getting those valuable insights that benefit your company end to end.</p>
<p>As a Gold Partner we live and breathe Tableau so the conferences are just as exciting for us as they are for you, so much so we&#8217;ve been working towards the London event since the start of the year.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ll be attending as sponsors and Tableau users, we thought we&#8217;d share some of the things we look forward to most about the Tableau Conferences:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>As one would expect we use Tableau. A lot. And we&#8217;re lucky enough to work with a wide variety of clients from just about every industry there is so we&#8217;re not short of a few stories and lessons learned over the years. The conferences are the perfect places to share what we&#8217;ve learned, as well as pick up a new trick or two as well which we can then share with our clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg" alt="BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S" width="525" height="397" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Making Friends</strong></p>
<p>The Tableau conferences are a great place for new faces as well as old. The sense of shared bond and community is second to none and it’s one of the stand out parts of the event that we look forward to. The volume of new Tableau users each year never fails to amaze us and as some of our team have been to every single conference, we can vouch for how much the events have changed, grown and improved every single year. And that’s largely down to the amazing people we meet year after year.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10479 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg" alt="GroupHug" width="510" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uplifting Events</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest draws for the conferences is the keynote speeches and customer presentations. London this year is no exception with economist and broadcaster Tim Harford, and data editor of The Economist Kenneth Cukier in attendance alongside leading lights at Tableau Software.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10480 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Event.jpg" alt="Event" width="509" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our very own Dan Murray (InterWorks Director of BI Services and author of “<a title="Tableau Your Data" href="http://tableauyourdata.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!</a>”) will be presenting alongside Facebook’s Andy Kriebel on July 8th at 3pm, delivering a talk on how to set up and run a successful Tableau User Group. Dan and Andy go way back so you can expect a lively presentation that&#8217;ll be as much fun to watch as it will be to deliver. Not to mention hugely useful for the growing number of groups out there. Andy Kriebel is a <a title="Tableau Zen Masters" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2012/11/masters-teachers-innovators-meet-tableau-zen-masters-19799" target="_blank">Tableau Zen Master</a> and writes the hugely popular blog <a title="VizWiz" href="http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">VizWiz</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks continues to experience incredible opportunities in the world of information technology, big data, business intelligence and development, allowing us to evolve into the global company we are today. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Our original branding has served us well over the years, but it&#8217;s time for a new brand that is the first step in our next phase of continued growth. So we present to you, the new look of InterWorks.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10145 aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0.png" width="254" height="139" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>InterWorks Evolved</h2>
<p>Our new logo is indeed conceptual and meant to evoke a wide variety of responses. This effect is intentionally representative of the relationship we seek to hold with our clients. No two are the same.</p>
<p>Above all, InterWorks solves business and technical problems with our blend of talent, experience and partnerships. Our people are dedicated and determined, and take great pride in applying this recipe to your business in a way that is unique to each engagement. The average and the mediocre in business consulting is not our style and flies in the face of our core belief and biggest challenge. It&#8217;s a challenge that we all thoroughly enjoy, and we pledge to maintain our belief indefinitely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-07%20at%203.18.40%20PM.png" width="631" height="277" /></p>
<p>You see, our people love working here because they are challenged daily. No two days are the same. No two challenges are the same. No two <em>clients </em>are the same. And that&#8217;s what makes it great. They live very near the cutting edge and thrive on every opportunity to dig deep into their natural talents and past experiences to solve puzzles. We&#8217;re all a little bit Batman in that respect. Because our clients experience this excitement firsthand, often seeing results beyond their expectations, powerful relationships form between client and consultant. Such relationships are unequaled in other business and IT consulting firms.</p>
<p>This unique connection is the foundation of our organization and the inspiration for our new logo:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/puzzles_2.png" width="647" height="147" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our people, our experience, our partnerships – all work together to complete the foundation of your business.</p>
<h2>But yet, it’s so much more …</h2>
<p>We mentioned that our new logo is intentionally conceptual. The goal is to elicit an understanding according to the beholder’s experience with InterWorks. This means we aren&#8217;t satisfied with just a new logo.</p>
<p>Our use will typically be the primary logo found at the beginning of the article, but the identity plays out in many forms and expressions. We are excited to see this visual form grow over time as we apply the concept in other ways; from its origin in completed foundations, to obvious opportunities in building blocks, stair and interconnected network webs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/spiderweb_0.jpg" width="667" height="346" /></p>
<p>Simply put, the landscape for unique expressions of our original concept will be an endeavour all of its own over the coming years and we can&#8217;t wait to get stuck in. Speaking for the creative folks in our marketing department, we are ecstatic!</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>In addition to the rollout of our new logo across this website and all other InterWorks properties, along with a full overhaul of all print and traditional collateral, we are actively working on a new website. Our goal is not to simply re-skin the websites that you know today. Instead, we’re re-envisioning our company from the ground up and working to provide the right digital representation of who we have become and where we are going.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of the changes? </strong></em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started my career as an electrical engineer graduating from the University of Southampton. I enjoyed engineering and the problem solving challenges it frequently provided but it wasn’t until I started running my own businesses that I discovered a wider version of problem solving.<br />
My second business ‘Total Console Repair’ was the point at which I really discovered Business Intelligence. I didn’t know I‘d discovered Business Intelligence, but I had.</p>
<p><strong>Total Console Repair</strong><br />
Total Console Repair Limited was a company which fixed consumer electronics, by the truck load. In order to service our large corporate clients and handle the vast quantities of units we needed to have a large number of repair technicians. Initially we used traditional management methods to monitor and get the most from our staff but we soon found a better way. We started setting Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) that the technicians could be compared against: Number of repairs, Ratio of repaired / failed, Warranty returns etc etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rob-PS3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10139" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rob-PS3-300x228.jpg" alt="Rob PS3" width="300" height="228" /></a></p>
<p>For the first few years we dashboarded all of this in Excel which pulled data from our Access database. I spent a lot of time and became a master of Excel. Typically a dashboard would take up to 10 days to create and often would require a full rebuild whenever we wanted to add a new measure. Imagine my delight when I was introduced to Tableau v4.0 by none other than our fearless leader at InterWorks Europe, Mel Stephenson. Suddenly I could create a dashboard in under a day and make modifications in minutes. As our business grew at an alarming rate we upgraded to MS SQL server and Tableau seamlessly accommodated the change in technology and business process.<br />
We started rolling out dashboards to other areas of the business. Call centre, Finance, Management, Sales. ISO 9000 accreditation said that each job role must be defined but we went a step further than that and gave each job role a dashboard which not only defined the important tasks but measured each staff member against their KPIs in real time.<br />
Sadly the recession hit the UK, most of our customers went in to administration and we had to shut down Total Console Repair. During the 18 month wind down period Tableau came in to its own again. We were able to vastly change the way we worked and alter business processes to combine job roles.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br />
After Total Console Repair ceased trading I couldn’t think of anything I would prefer to do than to advise and implement best use of Tableau within other organisations. I had become passionate about BI best practice; which is really Jargon for ‘making your job easier and more productive’. It’s not all about data; it’s about people and giving them the right information in the right way. A happy, stress-free workforce is a productive workforce.</p>

<p><strong>InterWorks</strong><br />
I was involved with InterWorks EU from the early days and it was a natural choice for me to join the team. I love working with Tableau every day and I also love the positive impact which can be created from implementing sound BI for clients. A good dashboard is like opening a window in to an otherwise black box. With enough well designed dashboards you can turn your company in to a transparent box with every aspect being visible to all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A question I was recently asked by an in training Tableau User was ‘Why would I apply a table calculation by cell?’. To answer this I have produced a simple example of a by cell Table Calculation. Before I get to it I would like to run through some Table Calculation basics.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation Direction</strong></p>
<p>One of the key principles in Table Calculations is the direction of the calculation. Consider the following table which shows the ‘Running Sum’ table calculation running ‘Table Across’:</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Across.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8743" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Across-300x170.png" alt="Across" width="300" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see this running sum is running horizontally left to right and restarting on each row.</p>
<p>If you ran the calculation again, this time &#8216;Table Down&#8217; the calculation would work vertically down the table restarting for each column.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Down.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8742" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Down-300x169.png" alt="Down" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Across then down&#8217; runs first horizontally and then carries the result to the next row running against the entire table:</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Across-Then-Down.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8741" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Across-Then-Down-300x171.png" alt="Across Then Down" width="300" height="171" /></a></p>
<p>Down then across runs vertically but carries the result to the next column of data, working across the whole table.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Down-then-across.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8740" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Down-then-across-300x173.png" alt="Down then across" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p><strong>By Cell</strong></p>
<p>The by cell calculation runs the calculation for a single cell of data (i.e. the lowest level of granularity in the view) Consider the following example:<br />
<script src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="width: 604px; height: 595px;"><noscript><a href="#"><img alt=" " src="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;By&#47;ByCell&#47;Acrossthendown_1&#47;1_rss.png" style="border: none" /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" style="display: none;" width="604" height="595"><param name="host_url" value="http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F" /><param name="site_root" value="" /><param name="name" value="ByCell/Acrossthendown_1" /><param name="tabs" value="yes" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /><param name="static_image" value="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/By/ByCell/Acrossthendown_1/1.png" /><param name="animate_transition" value="yes" /><param name="display_static_image" value="yes" /><param name="display_spinner" value="yes" /><param name="display_overlay" value="yes" /><param name="display_count" value="yes" /></object></div>
<div style="width: 604px; height: 22px; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px; color: black; font: normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float: right; padding-right: 8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/about-tableau-products?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/ByCell/Acrossthendown_1" target="_blank">Learn About Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>This chart shows Sales broken down by product type and market. I have applied ‘Type’ to the colour of the chart and set up my table calculation as percentage of total.</p>
<p>What I would like to see is the % split between decaf and regular sales for each Product Type and Market.</p>
<p>By default this calculation has been applied as &#8216;Table Across&#8217; so each colour split is the % of the total for the entire row of data.</p>
<p>If I want to see the split value for each cell I need to set the calculation to run ‘By Cell’. Click &#8216;By Cell&#8217; to see this calculation in action.</p>
<p>Now you can see that each cell of data has a total of 100% showing the split between Decaf and Regular drink sales.</p>
<p>Any questions at all, please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch. We love a challenge!</p>
