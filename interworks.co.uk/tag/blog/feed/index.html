				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>T-Minus 2 Days&#8230; (probably less if you read this before I update this countdown again!)</p>
<p>The Training Camps are almost complete and the tapering down is in progress&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Weigh-In is just around the corner which marks the Grand Finale in terms of preparations before the Main Event itself &#8211; &#8220;The Fight of the Century&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Click to open in new window" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/alastair.young#!/vizhome/MayweatherVsPacquiao-PathstotheFightoftheCentury/FightoftheCentury" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12261" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fight-of-the-Century-1024x812.png" alt="Fight of the Century" width="904" height="717" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">(Please click on the picture above to take you through to the live Dashboard hosted on Tableau Public)</h6>
<p>For 6+ years, boxing fans from across the globe have waited for this fight to happen. The endless and tedious, &#8216;Will-they Won&#8217;t-they&#8217; conundrum rattled on and on, far longer than anyone expected, and far longer than it ever should have. New discussions, new demands, purse agreements, drug testing, fight weight, glove weight&#8230;. All topics that in one way or another contributed to the fight not happening until now. With all this, the title of &#8216;The Best Pound-for-Pound Fighter in the World&#8217; is about to be decided either way and just to make it a little more interesting, let&#8217;s throw in the estimated $350 million in revenue it is likely to generate. It&#8217;s now quite easy to see why everyone is dubbing this &#8216;The Fight of the Century&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whoever wins &#8211; this has been the most hyped boxing match in recent years and rightly so. Neither fighter needs the money&#8230; but boxing as a sport needs this more than anything. Gone are days of the regular Big Fight Weekends.</p>
<p>Nothing will surprise its audience (apart from those at ringside whose pockets must feel considerably lighter). We all know each fighter&#8217;s capabilities, and are intrigued about both of their tactics going into the spectacle. Everyone has their favourite&#8230; it&#8217;s now just a case of who will WIN?</p>
<p>Mayweather is the supreme fighter with an unblemished professional record of 47-0-0 but&#8230; can he cope with Pacquiao&#8217;s speed? Can he take Pacquiao&#8217;s volume of punches? Can he continue to deal with the pressure of an undefeated record and the possibility of hitting the mat? &#8211; And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>Pacquiao in his own right is a phenomenal fighter. A sanctioned World Champion over 6 weight divisions throughout his career, but with some blemishes on 57-5-2 record. Have past defeats made him a better fighter? Can he play the long game against Mayweather? Can his speed and stance cause Mayweather to crumble? And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>With Mayweather currently favourite at odds of 1/2 and Pacquiao at odds of 2/1 to win outright, this is the closest and best odds for a Mayweather fight in recent years. Looking at the odds for an early stoppage (KO,TKO or DQ), Pacquiao is now favourite at 5/1 vs Mayweather at 13/2. This all may sound weird but this directly correlates to each of the fighter&#8217;s careers and how they have won their previous bouts. Mayweather stays for the long game but for Pacquiao it&#8217;s all about the knockouts.</p>
<p>Further information on each of the fighter&#8217;s professional careers can be found on the visualisation above. It provides historical fight data and statistics for each fighter in preparation for this weekend&#8217;s showdown. No matter what happens, it&#8217;s likely to be an amazing spectacle and hope it can live up to all its expectations.</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, I would love to see Manny Pacquiao knock out Floyd Mayweather &#8230;&#8230; underdogs can still win (remember Rahman beating Lennox Lewis!?)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News UK is home to The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun news brands. With 72% of adults in Britain in touch with News UK’s titles, digital products and brand extensions, the business has developed quite a bit of interesting data. So, why Tableau? And why InterWorks? You’re about to find out.</p>
<p>We recently met with Keith Guthrie, Pulse Analytics Lead at News UK, to discuss the implementation of Tableau within one of Britain’s biggest newspaper companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsul.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-11545 aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsul.jpg" alt="newsul" width="394" height="263" /></a></p>
<p><b>Before we dive into Tableau was there a prior business problem within News UK to justify the search for a new tool?</b></p>
<p>When I joined the reporting team, Business Intelligence (BI) was relatively new to News UK, with the team only being set up in November 2013. As you can imagine prior to this, there wasn’t a great deal going on. In terms of the BI world, News UK had quite a fragmented environment. With the falling demand for printed products affecting the entire UK newspaper market and a focus on a paid-for digital content, we needed to support a more strategic digital strategy.</p>
<p><b>What were you hoping to get out of a BI strategy?</b></p>
<p>We have implemented a strategy to take the company on a journey to maximise our data assets. We want to fully understand our customers: who they are, what they do and what they are interested in, in order to help focus our efforts. In short, we needed to understand the best revenue streams and improve the uptake of print and digital subscriptions or hybrid product packs.</p>
<p><b>What systems were you using before you found Tableau?</b></p>
<p>Prior to Tableau, our regular reporting was a niche set of Excel reports. As with most big organisations, the tool sets used were vast, but the key delivery mechanism for both reporting and analytics was Excel. We are now moving into an environment where we use SAS for analytics and Tableau for reporting and data visualisation.</p>
<p><b>So (you knew we’d ask this), why Tableau?</b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why we picked Tableau. The team completed extensive research and knew the analytics market well. News UK already had a Tableau deployment, so it seemed a good choice, and all we needed was another server to keep things separate. We wanted self-sufficiency and speed of implementation – both of which Tableau really delivered on.</p>
<p><b>What impressed you about Tableau?</b></p>
<p>Well, that’s easy. As I’ve already mentioned, the first was its speed of implementation. If we’d had selected another tool, we potentially wouldn’t be where we are today. Tableau also has strong visualisation capabilities. We are able to bring data – some of which we’d never seen before – to life quickly. Tableau also benefits from an incredibly easy interface. The whole team has picked up how to use it with little or no fuss.</p>
<p><b>Do you have a fixed infrastructure that supports News UK BI?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, but we are working on it. We have a data warehouse with a single customer view, but there are multiple repositories for customer and subscription data (eg. Finance has one, marketing has one, etc.). Tableau does allow us to integrate this data into a single view, but we need to extract all the information before doing this – and moving data around is pretty expensive. We’re getting there though, one step at a time.</p>
<p><b>What areas of the business are using it?</b></p>
<p>At the moment, BI is one of the only areas of the business that creates dashboards using Tableau. We use it to build reports for all areas of the business, including Finance (for subscription management), Marketing (for who’s reading or viewing what) and for the Editorial team. I’m cautious about giving full control of Tableau to other areas of the business, but once we have implemented our new data warehouse we will investigate further self-serve options.</p>
<p><b>What’s your favourite thing about Tableau?</b></p>
<p>I’ve only been in the team for six months and was asked to deliver an effective BI solution. Without Tableau, it would’ve been incredibly difficult to get to where we currently are and in such a short time. So, my favourite thing is that Tableau helps us deliver quick wins. Before we used the tool, reporting proved very hard to do as we didn’t have a stable data asset and we had to do ad-hoc bits and pieces to keep our stakeholders happy. Tableau allows us access to different data sources, with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p><b>Let’s talk about InterWorks. How did we help?</b></p>
<p>We were a little different in our approach to training. Firstly, I dislike classroom training – it’s a little boring and rarely relevant to real-life scenarios. Also, we all had a relatively good understanding of the tools out there and how to use them, so adopted the ‘have a play, use the training videos and see what we can find’ approach. To be honest, it worked quite well.</p>
<p>There were, however, a few things we couldn’t quite grasp and we asked Rob from InterWorks to troubleshoot all of our queries. He provided examples of best practice and even helped us deliver three-to-four projects in our two-day workshop. Four months later, we called upon you guys again as we needed help with geomapping and getting things pixel perfect.</p>
<p><b>What’s next for News UK and Tableau?</b></p>
<p>We’re trying to evolve the use of Tableau. We aspire to create 30 reports that everyone uses, rather than creating numerous separate reports for the different departments. At the moment, our focus is on migrating reports from Excel into Tableau, moving data sources and enhancing what we’ve got. In a year’s time, I aim for the entire company to be able to self-serve using Tableau.</p>
<p>So, there concludes our interview &#8211; another happy customer of Tableau and InterWorks. If you think we could help your business, or you&#8217;re having difficulties unlocking the true value of your data, click <a href="http://interworks.co.uk/tableau-services/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Especially, when this <a title="http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/1/90-preview-query-performance-improvements-36406" href="http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/1/90-preview-query-performance-improvements-36406" target="_blank">blog</a> post came out from the Tableau mothership.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Individual Query time improved by <strong>10x</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #3366ff;">Dashboard Query times improved by <strong>9x</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #3366ff;">Query Fusion improving times by <strong>2x</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #3366ff;">And Query Caching improving times by <strong>50x</strong></span></p>
<p>Those are some pretty bold figures to put out there..<br />
Not being one to believe everything that I’m told, I thought that maybe it would be great for someone to do their own independent testing to check on those numbers.</p>
<p>So…… I waited, and as no one did, it was left to me to do my own testing.<br />
So here we go….</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Build out 2 identical servers in Amazon Web Services EC2 (<a title="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a>)<br />
I went for an <strong>m3.2xlarge</strong> server which has 8 vCPU (Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2) and 30 GB of RAM. (A pretty standard server setup.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install Tableau 8.3 64bit Server on the first server, and Tableau 9 Beta 4 64-bit Server on the other.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload my 150 million row Data extract to both servers.<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a dashboard to query the Data Source. (if you click on the image it will expand)</p>
<div id="attachment_11308" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image001.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11308" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image001-300x246.png" alt="Tableau Server Performance Testing Dashboard" width="300" height="246" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau Server Performance Testing Dashboard</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Test dashboard, record the timings and compare.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>First let’s look at the Tableau 8.3 performance recording.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_11309" style="width: 357px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image003.png"><img class=" wp-image-11309" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image003-300x154.png" alt="Tableau 8.3 8 vCPU Performance Recording" width="347" height="178" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 8.3 8vCPU Performance Recording</p>
</div>
<p>So what we have here is a pretty standard Tableau 8 dashboard performance recording, with each query happening sequentially, one after the other.<br />
The duration of the longest query came in at 10.78 seconds, with the overall duration from start to finish of around 22 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Now, let’s take a look at the same query on Tableau 9 Server</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_11310" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image005.png"><img class=" wp-image-11310" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image005-300x153.png" alt="Tableau 9 8vCPU Performance Recording" width="345" height="176" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 9 8vCPU Performance Recording</p>
</div>
<p>Whoa!!! So what’s happening here then?</p>
<p>To start with, we have much shorter query durations, with the longest query length down from 10.78 to 5.4 seconds, and we also have parallel query executions to bring the overall time down from 22 seconds to 7.5 seconds</p>
<p>That’s not bad at all…<br />
Now, let’s take a look at the underlying server performance, to see what’s happening</p>
<p><strong>First the Tableau 8.3 server</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_11302" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image007.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11302" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image007-300x231.png" alt="Tableau 8.3 8vCPU CPU Performance" width="300" height="231" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 8.3 8vCPU CPU Performance</p>
</div>
<p>There are 2 points to notice here.</p>
<p>Firstly, the total processor usage never gets above 27% <span style="color: #0000ff;">[blue]</span> of what the server is capable of for the duration of the query.<br />
Secondly, both the VizQL (vizqlserver <span style="color: #800080;">[purple]</span>) and Data Engine (tdeserver64<span style="color: #339966;"> [green]</span>) processes max out at one vCPU each.</p>
<p><strong>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the Tableau 9 server..</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_11303" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image009.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11303" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image009-300x232.png" alt="Tableau 9 8vCPU CPU performance" width="300" height="232" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 9 8vCPU CPU performance</p>
</div>
<p>We see that again the VizQL process continues to use 1 vCPU, but now the Data Engine is multi-core, with the result that the total processor usage peaked at around 96%, and a much much shorter overall query time.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking; what effect does increasing the number of cores in a server have on the overall query times?</p>
<p>As you’ve asked so nicely, let’s find out…</p>
<p>I changed the underlying image on AWS from a m3.2xlarge to a c4.4xlarge for both the Tableau 8.3 and Tableau 9 Servers.</p>
<p>A <strong>c4.4xlarge</strong> server has 16 vCPU (Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3) with 30GB of RAM (effectively doubling the core count for this test)</p>
<p><strong>The same query run on Tableau 8.3 Server.</strong></p>
<table style="height: 27px; border-color: #fcfcfc;" border="0" width="431" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td style="border-color: #ffffff;">
<div id="attachment_11304" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image011.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11304" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image011-300x160.png" alt="Tableau 8.3 16vCPU Performance Recording" width="300" height="160" /></a>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 8.3 16vCPU Processor Performance</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We <em>do</em> see a shorter overall query time (down from 22 seconds to around 16 seconds).</p>
<p>But, we see the same process &amp; processor usage profile as Tableau 8.3 running on 8 vCPU, with only one core being used for each of the VizQL and Data Engine processes.<br />
(Note that the improved query times moving from 8 to 16 vCPU may well be due to the changes in the underlying hardware, including the use of a faster Processor.</p>
<p><strong>Now, on to Tableau 9 running on 16 vCPU</strong></p>
<table style="height: 259px; border-color: #fcfcfc;" border="0" width="641" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<tr>
<td style="border-color: #ffffff;" scope="row">

<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 9 16vCPU Performance Recording</p>

<td style="border-color: #ffffff;">

<p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau 9 16vCPU Processor Performance</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Again, we see the parallel querying and also, and an improvement in query times, with the longest query now taking 3.34 seconds, and the overall query time down to a sparkling 4.5 seconds.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the performance chart, where again we see the multi-core in action. (This time peaking at just under 60% utilisation)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So what to make of all those figures…</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In my test, moving from 8 vCPU to 16 vCPU give me a speed increase of around 30% for Tableau 8.3 and around 60% for Tableau 9. As I said earlier, this may well be due to the underlying hardware being better on the c4.4xlarge than on the m3.2xlarge, and nothing to do with Tableau itself. (Investigating this thoroughly is beyond the remit of this piece.)</li>
<li>However, upgrading from Tableau 8.3 to 9.0 on 8 vCPU server boosted performance by <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>just under 3 times</strong></span>, and for the 16 vCPU server, by <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>just</strong> <strong>over 3.5 times.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Those are some pretty thrilling figures. They&#8217;re not quite in the same league as the Tableau Blog figures, but still interesting enough..</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s going to depend on your own dashboards, your datasets and the overall load on your Servers, as to what performance improvements you will see.<br />
Also, in this testing I don’t take into account the other features offered in Tableau 9 such as Query Caching or Query Fusion (which I haven’t gone into here, and if no-one else writes about these features, I may have to do so myself)</p>
<p>So overall, you are going to see great improvements in the times taken to render dashboards. This is going to make your customers happier which is going to make you happier.<br />
However, what I’m not so sure about is what effect this upgrade is going to have on your servers.<br />
There are a few unknowns out there such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to see more user load on your Tableau server, as they now are more readily gain access to their reports?</li>
<li>Are you going to be publishing dashboards which you would never have done on Tableau 8 because their performance wasn’t acceptable, but is now (additional load)?</li>
<li>Is having a more ‘peaky’ CPU performance profile going to cause you issues, which may necessitate additional Hardware purchases?</li>
<li>Or will having Query Caching and Query Fusion save the day, and actually result in less load on the server?</li>
</ul>
<p>All these are questions and more are what makes this server upgrade extremely exciting and takes Tableau 9.0 to a #WholeNewLevel.
