				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike any other tool I&#8217;ve used before, Tableau invites exploration. One can start with a blank canvas and end up who knows where. That&#8217;s what makes Tableau fun to use. However strange that word looks when used in a work context, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>I had a challenge. I needed to produce a handout that compared survey data on two suppliers. We had twenty questions that were asked across 17 different functional areas by a bunch of people. That&#8217;s a lot of info.</p>
<p>Back  in the old days, I&#8217;d have ended up with a gloriously dull pivot table made in Excel. It would have either summarised the data to death, ending up with a one page table that aggregated away any meaning. Or maybe I&#8217;d have produced pages and pages of charts that showed the trees but not the forest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/15-03-11-11-37-33.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2253" title="15-03-11 11-37-33" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/15-03-11-11-37-33.png" alt="" width="634" height="444" /></a></p>
<p>Instead, I connect the data to Tableau and go on a trip.The end results is the trellis above (click it to see the full size version). So why did this particular chart get me excited enough to write a post about it?</p>
<p>Was it because 2,194 marks are being displayed on one page? Partly.</p>
<p>Was it because every single question and answer can be viewed on one page? Sure.</p>
<p>Was it because you can look down a whole row or across a whole column and see exactly where one supplier outperformed another? Kinda.</p>
<p>Was it because it is very quickly clear that the supplier with the black line largely outperforms the grey supplier? Definitely.</p>
<p>Or was it because my client took one look at it and almost fell over because it was exactly what they wanted? For sure.</p>
<p>Actually, the main reason was more than just the above. It was the fact that when I connected to the data, I had no idea what my end result was going to be. I knew it was going to printed out, so had to find a way to keep the page count down. How did I design the trellis? I didn&#8217;t &#8211; I just had an inkling of what might work, dropped Dimensions and Measures around as seemed relevant, and the end result emerged almost on its own.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why Tableau works: you don&#8217;t need to know where you&#8217;re going, just set off and you&#8217;ll end up somewhere pretty damn cool.</p>
