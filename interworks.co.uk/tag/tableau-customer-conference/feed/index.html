				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10483 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-13.14.22.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-12 at 13.14.22" width="628" height="179" /></a></p>
<p>It’s 24 days to go until the biggest Tableau event in Europe &#8211; <a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London</a>. If you’re a seasoned conference veteran you’ll know these events are huge. And this year is special because it was the first time the European event was split into three &#8211; The Hague, Munich and London. This gave the European Tableau community even more opportunity to share in the fun, the learning and the energy.</p>
<p>It’s by far the biggest and best opportunity for the Tableau community to come together to share their ideas, learn new ways of getting the very best from Tableau and enjoy all the fun that comes from being part of the most vibrant data analytics community in the world. There’s so much to do at the conferences it’s impossible not to come away feeling energised and brimming with new ideas of how to better implement Tableau in your role, getting those valuable insights that benefit your company end to end.</p>
<p>As a Gold Partner we live and breathe Tableau so the conferences are just as exciting for us as they are for you, so much so we&#8217;ve been working towards the London event since the start of the year.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ll be attending as sponsors and Tableau users, we thought we&#8217;d share some of the things we look forward to most about the Tableau Conferences:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>As one would expect we use Tableau. A lot. And we&#8217;re lucky enough to work with a wide variety of clients from just about every industry there is so we&#8217;re not short of a few stories and lessons learned over the years. The conferences are the perfect places to share what we&#8217;ve learned, as well as pick up a new trick or two as well which we can then share with our clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg" alt="BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S" width="525" height="397" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Making Friends</strong></p>
<p>The Tableau conferences are a great place for new faces as well as old. The sense of shared bond and community is second to none and it’s one of the stand out parts of the event that we look forward to. The volume of new Tableau users each year never fails to amaze us and as some of our team have been to every single conference, we can vouch for how much the events have changed, grown and improved every single year. And that’s largely down to the amazing people we meet year after year.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10479 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg" alt="GroupHug" width="510" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uplifting Events</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest draws for the conferences is the keynote speeches and customer presentations. London this year is no exception with economist and broadcaster Tim Harford, and data editor of The Economist Kenneth Cukier in attendance alongside leading lights at Tableau Software.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10480 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Event.jpg" alt="Event" width="509" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our very own Dan Murray (InterWorks Director of BI Services and author of “<a title="Tableau Your Data" href="http://tableauyourdata.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!</a>”) will be presenting alongside Facebook’s Andy Kriebel on July 8th at 3pm, delivering a talk on how to set up and run a successful Tableau User Group. Dan and Andy go way back so you can expect a lively presentation that&#8217;ll be as much fun to watch as it will be to deliver. Not to mention hugely useful for the growing number of groups out there. Andy Kriebel is a <a title="Tableau Zen Masters" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2012/11/masters-teachers-innovators-meet-tableau-zen-masters-19799" target="_blank">Tableau Zen Master</a> and writes the hugely popular blog <a title="VizWiz" href="http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">VizWiz</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DanMurray.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9708" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DanMurray-274x300.jpg" alt="Andy Kriebel" width="183" height="200" /></a><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AndyKriebel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10491" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AndyKriebel-300x200.jpg" alt="AndyKriebel" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London </a>is going to be a phenomenal event. With so many opportunities to learn the ways of Tableau, hear how Tableau has changed some of the biggest companies in the world and bond with your fellow users &#8211; the Tableau customer appreciation party is a must &#8211; it’ll no doubt be the first step towards you becoming a Tableau Jedi.</p>
<p>Make sure you visit our stand and say hi. The team will be there to answer any Tableau questions you may have, swap stories or you can check out a demo of the powerhouse of tools we have created: Power Tools for Tableau.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks is preparing for the biggest data visualization event in Europe to date: the Tableau Conference on Tour. Many are familiar with the European Tableau Customer Conference, which historically takes place in one location over the course of a week. This year, Tableau is opting to switch things up a bit. They’re taking their European conference on tour to three of Europe’s finest cities. Like the rabid Tableau fans we are, we’ll soon be packing our bags to join Tableau on this legendary tour.</p>
<h2><b>When and Where Will the Tour Take Place?</b></h2>
<p>The European leg of the tour is set for various dates between May and July. By splitting the European tour amongst three different cities, Tableau aims to give attendees a more relatable and focused experience based on the unique environment of each region. Below are the tour stops along with their respective dates:</p>
<p>19-21 May, 2014 | Den Haag, NL</p>
<p>26-28 May, 2014 | München, DE</p>
<p>7-9 July, 2014 | London, UK</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/">official Tableau Conference on Tour website</a>.</p>
<p>Not able to make it? The Tableau Conference on Tour isn’t the only opportunity to see Tableau and InterWorks in action. We’ll also be at TCC14 in Seattle later this year. If you think the Tableau Conference on Tour is a big deal, just wait until we kick off the biggest Tableau party of the year at TCC14.</p>
<h2><b>InterWorks a Top Sponsor</b></h2>
<p>As a leading Tableau Gold Partner, we’re carrying on our tradition of sponsorship for yet another year. This means much more to us than buying a bit of advertising. It means we’ll be well represented at each event stop, standing ready to share our wealth of Tableau wisdom with attendees. We can’t wait to hear about all the exciting things people are doing with their data. We have a few surprises that you&#8217;ll just have to see for yourself.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: InterWorks presenting at TCCEU 2013.</em></p>
<h2>Get an Exclusive Look into Power Tools for Tableau</h2>
<p>We’re especially excited for the tour because it gives us the chance to show attendees our revolutionary Power Tools for Tableau. If you haven’t checked them out, head over to <a href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/" target="_blank">the official Power Tools website</a> to get the down-low. Be sure to download the free demo of the Workbook SDK. We’ll be giving live demos of Power Tools at each event, so you won’t want to miss them!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code></code>The Tableau Customer Conference 2013 turned out to be a truly inspiring event. Hans Rosling captured the hearts and minds of the packed event room as did Andy Kriebel (Facebook), JP Rangaswami (Salesforce), Tableau’s own Christian Chabot and many customer speakers such as Cisco’s Rob Higgins / Paul Laza, Unilever and Medway Youth Trust’s Gary Seaman.</p>
<p>The event featured 11 stages for concurrent presentations and with so many informative and interesting speakers it was often a tough choice to make. Needless to say the wealth of knowledge at the event was incredible; it was great to see the innovative ways in which Tableau is being used as well as the achievements made by organisations and individuals to overcome common data issues. There were many teaching sessions as well as the ‘Tableau Doctor’ booth to help with learning / creative dashboarding and problem solving.</p>
<p>InterWorks were a gold sponsor of the event and had a great presence there especially when the InterWorks Tiger showed up and ‘assisted’ with Facebook’s presentation. Despite the intervention Andy Kriebel still had some solid praise for the work that InterWorks do “The best consultants in the business&#8230;&#8230;..hands down”. Thanks Andy, we try.</p>
<p><a title="InterWorks" href="http://interworks.co.uk/" target="_blank">InterWorks</a> have been working closely with the charity ‘Medway Youth Trust’. Gary Seaman’s talk on predictive modelling and text analytics was a real hit at the show and generated a huge buzz. This type of modelling is an incredible way to gain insight into rich data from free-text fields and Gary has used it to help identify some of the UK’s most ‘at risk’ children.</p>
<p>Google Big Data had a great presence at the event and generated a lot of interest in their incredibly accessible and secure database platform. I think we can also see some exciting things coming from Datasift’s data acquisition tool in the near future.</p>
<p>InterWorks were presented with the Marketing Excellence Award for their Tableau work during the last year. This award was received by Dan Murray, author of the highly anticipated book “<a title="Tableau Your Data!: Fast and Easy Visual Analysis with Tableau Software" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1118612043" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!: Fast and Easy Visual Analysis with Tableau Software</a>“ which will be out really soon.</p>
<p>If you missed this 5 Star event do not despair because the next conference is in <a title="Washington DC" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/learn/events/2013-tableau-customer-conference" target="_blank">Washington DC</a> and looks set to be the biggest ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tableau 8 Beta was released to conference attendees last week, the beta program gets the software out to real world content producers and gives Tableau feedback on any bugs or last minute feature requests. Tableau do a great job with their releases, as each year they jump the competition in features and usability.</p>
<p>Just a few of the great new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treemaps</li>
<li>Wordclouds</li>
<li>Data blending without needing the joining field in the viz (this is great by the way!)</li>
<li>Greater control over the content and formatting of tooltips including adding dimensions and measures that are not used in the viz</li>
<li>Floating panels allowing unlimited arrangement of worksheets on a dashboard</li>
<li>Quick Filters can now be set to affect select worksheets, rather all or one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is far longer than this and we&#8217;ll be demonstrating some of the new features in our blog over the coming few weeks, keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a viz that demonstrates a few of the features detailed above (not live unfortunately as Tableau Public is still v7):</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tableau Customer Conference is always fantastic.</p>
<p>We always tell our customers that if they can spare the time and budget then they&#8217;ve got to go. How good are they? They&#8217;re so good this will be my fifth Tableau conference in a row!</p>
<p>This year promises to be as great as ever with customer stories that are always stimulating and thought-provoking. Everyone I know has left each Tableau conference excited about data, inspired by Tableau and energised by the infectious enthusiasm of each <a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/statwars-logo-on-shirt-yoda1.jpg" target="_blank">Tableau Wan Kenobi</a> they met.</p>
<p>After all those great sessions you&#8217;ll want to share a little of beautiful Barcelona with those people. Luckily, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/107015847631643794739/about" target="_blank">+Andy Cotgreave</a> (@acotgreave) is here to inform in classic Tableau style with an interactive guide to a little of Barcelona&#8217;s nightlife.</p>
<p>Enjoy the viz. Use it wisely. And we look forward to seeing you there!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tableau&#8217;s second European conference is fast approaching (for full details click here). I cannot recommend these conferences highly enough. Tableau&#8217;s organisation at these events is faultless and the speakers are inspirational.</p>
<p>The conference is also a great opportunity to meet other fellow Tableau evangelists and see how they are putting Tableau to use within their organisations. I think the value of attending these is so high that it is company policy for everyone at The Data Studio to attend (funnily enough I haven&#8217;t had any objection from anyone about this policy!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to present at some of the previous conferences and I thought I&#8217;d see if I might speak this year on something we feel often gets overlooked: Tableau Server.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/On_Her_Majestys_Secret_Server_Cover_copy.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-3101 aligncenter" title="Secret Server" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Secret-Server1-209x300.png" alt="" width="167" height="240" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Click the image!</p>
<p>I often think that if Tableau Desktop is the lead singer of the band (all the glory, the oohs and aahs), Tableau Server is like all the rest of the band (quietly doing all the work of pulling it all together and making it glorious).</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d at least have some fun with making a poster for the application. Here it is for your amusement too. Click on the image for a large version to see the hidden jokes.</p>
<p>I hope I get to meet some of you in Barcelona.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the recent Tableau Customer Conference (more on this later) one of the many excellent sessions I sat in on was Tips and Tricks From The Wild.</p>
<p>Last up was the Tableau jedi, Joe Mako (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/joemako" target="_blank">@joemako</a> or on<a href="https://plus.google.com/112115806334864192512/posts" target="_blank"> Google+</a>). Within the Tableau community Joe is famed and respected for his ability to see straight to the heart of a problem and work out the shortest route to it. When, at the very end of his session someone (I think it was Tom Brown &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/_tombrown_" target="_blank">@_tombrown_</a> also on <a href="https://plus.google.com/108296725383510328518" target="_blank">Google+</a>) asked him how did he this I was intrigued to hear what Joe would say.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/joemako/status/127549616152510465" target="_blank">tweeted </a>Joe&#8217;s great answer, Noah Iliinsky (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noahi" target="_blank">@noahi</a>) was kind enough to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noahi/status/127555315368599552" target="_blank">contribute </a>saying he would add &#8216;know your audience&#8217; to the list. I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>So here you have it. If you want to be quick and effective at delivering meaningful, accessible and above all <em>relevant</em> data for people just follow these four pointers.</p>
<ul>
<li>know your data structure</li>
<li>know what you want to achieve</li>
<li>know how to use Tableau</li>
<li>know your audience</li>
</ul>
