				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks continues to experience incredible opportunities in the world of information technology, big data, business intelligence and development, allowing us to evolve into the global company we are today. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Our original branding has served us well over the years, but it&#8217;s time for a new brand that is the first step in our next phase of continued growth. So we present to you, the new look of InterWorks.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10145 aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0.png" width="254" height="139" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>InterWorks Evolved</h2>
<p>Our new logo is indeed conceptual and meant to evoke a wide variety of responses. This effect is intentionally representative of the relationship we seek to hold with our clients. No two are the same.</p>
<p>Above all, InterWorks solves business and technical problems with our blend of talent, experience and partnerships. Our people are dedicated and determined, and take great pride in applying this recipe to your business in a way that is unique to each engagement. The average and the mediocre in business consulting is not our style and flies in the face of our core belief and biggest challenge. It&#8217;s a challenge that we all thoroughly enjoy, and we pledge to maintain our belief indefinitely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-07%20at%203.18.40%20PM.png" width="631" height="277" /></p>
<p>You see, our people love working here because they are challenged daily. No two days are the same. No two challenges are the same. No two <em>clients </em>are the same. And that&#8217;s what makes it great. They live very near the cutting edge and thrive on every opportunity to dig deep into their natural talents and past experiences to solve puzzles. We&#8217;re all a little bit Batman in that respect. Because our clients experience this excitement firsthand, often seeing results beyond their expectations, powerful relationships form between client and consultant. Such relationships are unequaled in other business and IT consulting firms.</p>
<p>This unique connection is the foundation of our organization and the inspiration for our new logo:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/puzzles_2.png" width="647" height="147" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our people, our experience, our partnerships – all work together to complete the foundation of your business.</p>
<h2>But yet, it’s so much more …</h2>
<p>We mentioned that our new logo is intentionally conceptual. The goal is to elicit an understanding according to the beholder’s experience with InterWorks. This means we aren&#8217;t satisfied with just a new logo.</p>
<p>Our use will typically be the primary logo found at the beginning of the article, but the identity plays out in many forms and expressions. We are excited to see this visual form grow over time as we apply the concept in other ways; from its origin in completed foundations, to obvious opportunities in building blocks, stair and interconnected network webs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/spiderweb_0.jpg" width="667" height="346" /></p>
<p>Simply put, the landscape for unique expressions of our original concept will be an endeavour all of its own over the coming years and we can&#8217;t wait to get stuck in. Speaking for the creative folks in our marketing department, we are ecstatic!</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>In addition to the rollout of our new logo across this website and all other InterWorks properties, along with a full overhaul of all print and traditional collateral, we are actively working on a new website. Our goal is not to simply re-skin the websites that you know today. Instead, we’re re-envisioning our company from the ground up and working to provide the right digital representation of who we have become and where we are going.</p>
