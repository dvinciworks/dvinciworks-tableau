				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s getting ever closer to the biggest Tableau Event of the year &#8211; the Tableau Conference on Tour. This year Tableau will be hitting Singapore, London, Berlin and Melbourne, showing the world truly how great Tableau is.</p>
<h2><b>When and Where Will the Tour Take Place?</b></h2>
<p>The European leg of the tour is set for various dates between June and July. We&#8217;re excited to be sponsoring both Berlin and London:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks EU is returning to the world’s largest IT exposition, CeBIT. InterWorks EU joins data visualization giant, Tableau Software to demonstrate the power of cutting-edge visual analysis in Tableau. Both InterWorks and Tableau will be at the ready to provide demos and answer any questions attendees may have surrounding Tableau consultancy and training.</p>
<p><strong>Another Landmark Year for Tableau, InterWorks</strong></p>
<p>Tableau has been nothing short of brilliant over the past year. The release of Tableau 8.1 has taken the software’s capabilities to soaring new heights. The highly-anticipated Tableau 8.2 is expected to continue this pattern. This excellence has not gone unnoticed. Gartner, a top technologic research firm, heralded Tableau as <i>the </i>BI and analytic<i> </i>leader in their 2014 “Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms”.</p>
<p>While Tableau continues to make strides in data analysis products, InterWorks EU has done so in Tableau and data services. Most noticeably, InterWorks EU was InterWorks UK at last year’s CeBIT. True to the change of name, InterWorks EU has shifted their focus to include the whole of Europe.</p>
<p><b>About CeBIT 2014</b></p>
<p>CeBIT 2014 brings the best and brightest technology vendors from across the globe together for five days of innovative gadgetry, engaging sessions, and extensive networking. Held at the Hannover Exhibition Grounds in Hannover, Germany, CeBIT 2014 will be the staging grounds for the latest technologies, best practices and success stories for the upcoming year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code></code>The Tableau Customer Conference 2013 turned out to be a truly inspiring event. Hans Rosling captured the hearts and minds of the packed event room as did Andy Kriebel (Facebook), JP Rangaswami (Salesforce), Tableau’s own Christian Chabot and many customer speakers such as Cisco’s Rob Higgins / Paul Laza, Unilever and Medway Youth Trust’s Gary Seaman.</p>
<p>The event featured 11 stages for concurrent presentations and with so many informative and interesting speakers it was often a tough choice to make. Needless to say the wealth of knowledge at the event was incredible; it was great to see the innovative ways in which Tableau is being used as well as the achievements made by organisations and individuals to overcome common data issues. There were many teaching sessions as well as the ‘Tableau Doctor’ booth to help with learning / creative dashboarding and problem solving.</p>
<p>InterWorks were a gold sponsor of the event and had a great presence there especially when the InterWorks Tiger showed up and ‘assisted’ with Facebook’s presentation. Despite the intervention Andy Kriebel still had some solid praise for the work that InterWorks do “The best consultants in the business&#8230;&#8230;..hands down”. Thanks Andy, we try.</p>
<p><a title="InterWorks" href="http://interworks.co.uk/" target="_blank">InterWorks</a> have been working closely with the charity ‘Medway Youth Trust’. Gary Seaman’s talk on predictive modelling and text analytics was a real hit at the show and generated a huge buzz. This type of modelling is an incredible way to gain insight into rich data from free-text fields and Gary has used it to help identify some of the UK’s most ‘at risk’ children.</p>
<p>Google Big Data had a great presence at the event and generated a lot of interest in their incredibly accessible and secure database platform. I think we can also see some exciting things coming from Datasift’s data acquisition tool in the near future.</p>
<p>InterWorks were presented with the Marketing Excellence Award for their Tableau work during the last year. This award was received by Dan Murray, author of the highly anticipated book “<a title="Tableau Your Data!: Fast and Easy Visual Analysis with Tableau Software" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1118612043" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!: Fast and Easy Visual Analysis with Tableau Software</a>“ which will be out really soon.</p>
<p>If you missed this 5 Star event do not despair because the next conference is in <a title="Washington DC" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/learn/events/2013-tableau-customer-conference" target="_blank">Washington DC</a> and looks set to be the biggest ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tableau 8 Beta was released to conference attendees last week, the beta program gets the software out to real world content producers and gives Tableau feedback on any bugs or last minute feature requests. Tableau do a great job with their releases, as each year they jump the competition in features and usability.</p>
<p>Just a few of the great new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treemaps</li>
<li>Wordclouds</li>
<li>Data blending without needing the joining field in the viz (this is great by the way!)</li>
<li>Greater control over the content and formatting of tooltips including adding dimensions and measures that are not used in the viz</li>
<li>Floating panels allowing unlimited arrangement of worksheets on a dashboard</li>
<li>Quick Filters can now be set to affect select worksheets, rather all or one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is far longer than this and we&#8217;ll be demonstrating some of the new features in our blog over the coming few weeks, keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a viz that demonstrates a few of the features detailed above (not live unfortunately as Tableau Public is still v7):</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting the blog &#8211; if you are visiting here as a result of my Tableau European Customer Conference session, welcome along. The best way to keep up to date with new posts is via my twitter feed (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/acotgreave">@acotgreave</a>).</p>
<p>My session was all about tooltips, and ways you can use them to enhance your visualisation and make your audience&#8217;s lives a lot easier. I have posts on various tooltip topics:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you like a bottle of Dom Perignon 2000 vintage champagne? If so, read on.</p>
<p>There are many things that make working in a business intelligence consultancy enormously satisfying:<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> you&#8217;re presented with a constant stream of fresh, interesting and stimulating challenges<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> you get to meet some truly great organisations, big and small, in all manner of sectors<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> you get to meet some inspirational leaders (some of whom are running the company and some of whom are working within the company)</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one thing I really struggle with and recently, when I ran a workshop on business intelligence for some of the superstars of the local business scene, I confessed this to the group there.</p>
<p>My problem is the short, crisp description of the business and what we do &#8211; a part of the elevator pitch. Give me ten minutes, some visuals (and a room with all the exits blocked) and I like to think I do a good job of explaining the power of business intelligence / data visualisation / guided analytics. But frankly who wants to sit next to someone who takes that long to say what they do? Certainly not me.</p>
<p>I spend my days making dashboards that are powerful, to-the-point communication tools. So where&#8217;s my powerful, to-the-point description of what I do? What&#8217;s a great way to describe dashboards or BI to someone who&#8217;s never heard of either?</p>
<p>One of the people in the workshop, almost without hesitation, came up with the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>We gather, store and retrieve timely, accurate and relevant information so that sensible business decisions can be made</em>&#8220;<br />
<span style="font-size: small;"> (Giles Henschel, MD and clearly smashing chap, </span><a title="Olives et Al" href="http://www.olivesetal.co.uk" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: small;">Olives et Al</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, probably © by now!)</span></p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to do is throw this challenge out to a wider audience and so I&#8217;d like to offer  a cheeky bottle of champagne for the person who best answers the following:</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s a great, engaging, accessible description of our world of business intelligence and data visualisation?</em></p>
<p>Please add them as comments below so others can see your contributions.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve made it down this far, we&#8217;ll unblock the exits&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"> The boring bit: Closing date for suggestions is Oct 31</span><sup><span style="font-size: small;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: small;">, 2010. The judge&#8217;s decision is final. The prize has no cash value. It&#8217;s just a bit of fun. Other terms and conditions may apply and I&#8217;ll make those up if someone asks me a question about the competition.</span></p>
