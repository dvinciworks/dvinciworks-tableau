				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10483 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-12-at-13.14.22.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-12 at 13.14.22" width="628" height="179" /></a></p>
<p>It’s 24 days to go until the biggest Tableau event in Europe &#8211; <a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London</a>. If you’re a seasoned conference veteran you’ll know these events are huge. And this year is special because it was the first time the European event was split into three &#8211; The Hague, Munich and London. This gave the European Tableau community even more opportunity to share in the fun, the learning and the energy.</p>
<p>It’s by far the biggest and best opportunity for the Tableau community to come together to share their ideas, learn new ways of getting the very best from Tableau and enjoy all the fun that comes from being part of the most vibrant data analytics community in the world. There’s so much to do at the conferences it’s impossible not to come away feeling energised and brimming with new ideas of how to better implement Tableau in your role, getting those valuable insights that benefit your company end to end.</p>
<p>As a Gold Partner we live and breathe Tableau so the conferences are just as exciting for us as they are for you, so much so we&#8217;ve been working towards the London event since the start of the year.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ll be attending as sponsors and Tableau users, we thought we&#8217;d share some of the things we look forward to most about the Tableau Conferences:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>As one would expect we use Tableau. A lot. And we&#8217;re lucky enough to work with a wide variety of clients from just about every industry there is so we&#8217;re not short of a few stories and lessons learned over the years. The conferences are the perfect places to share what we&#8217;ve learned, as well as pick up a new trick or two as well which we can then share with our clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg" alt="BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S" width="525" height="397" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Making Friends</strong></p>
<p>The Tableau conferences are a great place for new faces as well as old. The sense of shared bond and community is second to none and it’s one of the stand out parts of the event that we look forward to. The volume of new Tableau users each year never fails to amaze us and as some of our team have been to every single conference, we can vouch for how much the events have changed, grown and improved every single year. And that’s largely down to the amazing people we meet year after year.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10479 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg" alt="GroupHug" width="510" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uplifting Events</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest draws for the conferences is the keynote speeches and customer presentations. London this year is no exception with economist and broadcaster Tim Harford, and data editor of The Economist Kenneth Cukier in attendance alongside leading lights at Tableau Software.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10480 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Event.jpg" alt="Event" width="509" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our very own Dan Murray (InterWorks Director of BI Services and author of “<a title="Tableau Your Data" href="http://tableauyourdata.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!</a>”) will be presenting alongside Facebook’s Andy Kriebel on July 8th at 3pm, delivering a talk on how to set up and run a successful Tableau User Group. Dan and Andy go way back so you can expect a lively presentation that&#8217;ll be as much fun to watch as it will be to deliver. Not to mention hugely useful for the growing number of groups out there. Andy Kriebel is a <a title="Tableau Zen Masters" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2012/11/masters-teachers-innovators-meet-tableau-zen-masters-19799" target="_blank">Tableau Zen Master</a> and writes the hugely popular blog <a title="VizWiz" href="http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">VizWiz</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DanMurray.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9708" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DanMurray-274x300.jpg" alt="Andy Kriebel" width="183" height="200" /></a><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AndyKriebel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10491" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AndyKriebel-300x200.jpg" alt="AndyKriebel" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London </a>is going to be a phenomenal event. With so many opportunities to learn the ways of Tableau, hear how Tableau has changed some of the biggest companies in the world and bond with your fellow users &#8211; the Tableau customer appreciation party is a must &#8211; it’ll no doubt be the first step towards you becoming a Tableau Jedi.</p>
<p>Make sure you visit our stand and say hi. The team will be there to answer any Tableau questions you may have, swap stories or you can check out a demo of the powerhouse of tools we have created: Power Tools for Tableau.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks is preparing for the biggest data visualization event in Europe to date: the Tableau Conference on Tour. Many are familiar with the European Tableau Customer Conference, which historically takes place in one location over the course of a week. This year, Tableau is opting to switch things up a bit. They’re taking their European conference on tour to three of Europe’s finest cities. Like the rabid Tableau fans we are, we’ll soon be packing our bags to join Tableau on this legendary tour.</p>
<h2><b>When and Where Will the Tour Take Place?</b></h2>
<p>The European leg of the tour is set for various dates between May and July. By splitting the European tour amongst three different cities, Tableau aims to give attendees a more relatable and focused experience based on the unique environment of each region. Below are the tour stops along with their respective dates:</p>
<p>19-21 May, 2014 | Den Haag, NL</p>
<p>26-28 May, 2014 | München, DE</p>
<p>7-9 July, 2014 | London, UK</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/">official Tableau Conference on Tour website</a>.</p>
<p>Not able to make it? The Tableau Conference on Tour isn’t the only opportunity to see Tableau and InterWorks in action. We’ll also be at TCC14 in Seattle later this year. If you think the Tableau Conference on Tour is a big deal, just wait until we kick off the biggest Tableau party of the year at TCC14.</p>
<h2><b>InterWorks a Top Sponsor</b></h2>
<p>As a leading Tableau Gold Partner, we’re carrying on our tradition of sponsorship for yet another year. This means much more to us than buying a bit of advertising. It means we’ll be well represented at each event stop, standing ready to share our wealth of Tableau wisdom with attendees. We can’t wait to hear about all the exciting things people are doing with their data. We have a few surprises that you&#8217;ll just have to see for yourself.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: InterWorks presenting at TCCEU 2013.</em></p>
<h2>Get an Exclusive Look into Power Tools for Tableau</h2>
<p>We’re especially excited for the tour because it gives us the chance to show attendees our revolutionary Power Tools for Tableau. If you haven’t checked them out, head over to <a href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/" target="_blank">the official Power Tools website</a> to get the down-low. Be sure to download the free demo of the Workbook SDK. We’ll be giving live demos of Power Tools at each event, so you won’t want to miss them!</p>
