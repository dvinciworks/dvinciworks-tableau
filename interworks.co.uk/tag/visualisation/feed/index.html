				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>T-Minus 2 Days&#8230; (probably less if you read this before I update this countdown again!)</p>
<p>The Training Camps are almost complete and the tapering down is in progress&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Weigh-In is just around the corner which marks the Grand Finale in terms of preparations before the Main Event itself &#8211; &#8220;The Fight of the Century&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Click to open in new window" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/alastair.young#!/vizhome/MayweatherVsPacquiao-PathstotheFightoftheCentury/FightoftheCentury" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12261" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fight-of-the-Century-1024x812.png" alt="Fight of the Century" width="904" height="717" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">(Please click on the picture above to take you through to the live Dashboard hosted on Tableau Public)</h6>
<p>For 6+ years, boxing fans from across the globe have waited for this fight to happen. The endless and tedious, &#8216;Will-they Won&#8217;t-they&#8217; conundrum rattled on and on, far longer than anyone expected, and far longer than it ever should have. New discussions, new demands, purse agreements, drug testing, fight weight, glove weight&#8230;. All topics that in one way or another contributed to the fight not happening until now. With all this, the title of &#8216;The Best Pound-for-Pound Fighter in the World&#8217; is about to be decided either way and just to make it a little more interesting, let&#8217;s throw in the estimated $350 million in revenue it is likely to generate. It&#8217;s now quite easy to see why everyone is dubbing this &#8216;The Fight of the Century&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whoever wins &#8211; this has been the most hyped boxing match in recent years and rightly so. Neither fighter needs the money&#8230; but boxing as a sport needs this more than anything. Gone are days of the regular Big Fight Weekends.</p>
<p>Nothing will surprise its audience (apart from those at ringside whose pockets must feel considerably lighter). We all know each fighter&#8217;s capabilities, and are intrigued about both of their tactics going into the spectacle. Everyone has their favourite&#8230; it&#8217;s now just a case of who will WIN?</p>
<p>Mayweather is the supreme fighter with an unblemished professional record of 47-0-0 but&#8230; can he cope with Pacquiao&#8217;s speed? Can he take Pacquiao&#8217;s volume of punches? Can he continue to deal with the pressure of an undefeated record and the possibility of hitting the mat? &#8211; And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>Pacquiao in his own right is a phenomenal fighter. A sanctioned World Champion over 6 weight divisions throughout his career, but with some blemishes on 57-5-2 record. Have past defeats made him a better fighter? Can he play the long game against Mayweather? Can his speed and stance cause Mayweather to crumble? And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>With Mayweather currently favourite at odds of 1/2 and Pacquiao at odds of 2/1 to win outright, this is the closest and best odds for a Mayweather fight in recent years. Looking at the odds for an early stoppage (KO,TKO or DQ), Pacquiao is now favourite at 5/1 vs Mayweather at 13/2. This all may sound weird but this directly correlates to each of the fighter&#8217;s careers and how they have won their previous bouts. Mayweather stays for the long game but for Pacquiao it&#8217;s all about the knockouts.</p>
<p>Further information on each of the fighter&#8217;s professional careers can be found on the visualisation above. It provides historical fight data and statistics for each fighter in preparation for this weekend&#8217;s showdown. No matter what happens, it&#8217;s likely to be an amazing spectacle and hope it can live up to all its expectations.</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, I would love to see Manny Pacquiao knock out Floyd Mayweather &#8230;&#8230; underdogs can still win (remember Rahman beating Lennox Lewis!?)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">PART 2</span></p>
<p>In <a title="Interacting with your Trend Line in Tableau (Part 1)" href="http://interworks.co.uk/blog/linear-regression-interacting-trend-line/" target="_blank">part one</a> we familiarised with Tableau&#8217;s automatic Trend Line, information provided and inferences possible. Now I want to focus on the fun part: how to calculate the trend line ourselves using Tableau-R integration as well as two applied examples &#8220;How much above/below ?&#8221; and &#8220;What if&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><b>HOW TO CALCULATE A LINEAR TREND LINE USING TABLEAU &amp; R INTEGRATION? </b></span></p>
<p>Tableau provides (at least) two main options to calculate a trend line: either you could use Tableau’s R integration or calculated fields.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">TABLEAU-R-INTEGRATION</span></li>
</ol>
<p>If you know a bit of R, then you’re spot on – Tableau R integration saves you writing complicated Tableau calculations. Connect to R [1] and create the following calculated field ”R Trend Line”:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">          SCRIPT_REAL</span>(</p>
<p>&#8221; tl &lt;- <span style="color: #0000ff;">lm</span>( .arg2 ~ .arg1)</p>
<p>tl$fitted &#8221; ,</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">          SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">x</span>]), <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">y</span>]))</p>
<p>A note for Tableau-R beginners: the equation</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">          <span style="color: #0000ff;">lm</span>( .arg2 ~ .arg1)</p>
<p>calculates all parts of the Trend Line (slope, intercept, estimated values). Because Tableau can only retrieve a <em>single</em> column from R (but no matrix or table), we need to extract the estimated values to be displayed in the dual axis chart by using „tl$fitted“.</p>
<p>Now include the calculated trend line into the chart. To do so, drop &#8220;R Trend Line” onto the row shelf – don’t worry if the chart is empty at first! Right click on the Trend Line calculation and adjust ‘Compute Using’ to ID (see Figure 8). Then choose ‘Dual Axis’ – and you’re nearly done.</p>
<p>The calculated and the automatic trend line do not lie on top of each other quite yet. It needs Axis Synchronisation – only Tableau does not allow this: this option is greyed out.</p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-9-R-Trendline.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11973" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-9-R-Trendline-300x248.jpg" alt="Fig 9 R Trendline" width="381" height="315" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>Figure 9: Interactive Menu ‘Axis synchronisation’</p>
<p>Why is this? The reason is simple: if data types of the two axes differ, Tableau cannot synchronise them. Thus convert the Trend Line with the  <span style="color: #0000ff;">INT</span>() function:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">INT</span>(</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">SCRIPT_REAL</span>(</p>
<p>&#8221; tl &lt;- lm( .arg2 ~ .arg1)</p>
<p>tl$fitted &#8221; ,</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">          SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">x</span>]), <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">y</span>]))</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>And – voila! &#8211;  there is the synchronisation function back. Now the Trend Lines matches.</p>
<p>Note: the above calculation can be written in a single line, of course; the spacious presentation is only a way to make it easier for you to understand Tableau spelling.</p>
<p>However, if your plot looks still strange, because your R Trend Line appears as a dotted line although you have chosen &#8216;Line&#8217; in the marks card, then remove &gt; Measure Names &lt; (see Fig. 10, red circle) from the Trend Line card.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-10-two-dots-plot.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11974" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-10-two-dots-plot-300x183.png" alt="Fig 10 two dots plot" width="475" height="290" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 10: remove &gt;Measure Names&lt; from marks card to see R Trend Line as a line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">PRACTICAL EXAMPLES</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Example 1: &#8220;How much above the Line?” </span></p>
<p>What do you do if you want to quantify and visualise the deviation of an observation (data point)  from the Trend Line?  That’s easy, now; right? Just calculate &#8220;How much above the Line?” in a calculated Field using</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">y</span>]) – <span style="color: #ff6600;">[Trend Line]</span>.</p>
<p>Remember: the y-axis in a scatter plot is <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">y</span>]) and NOT just y.</p>
<p>When you have the trend line on the row shelf with &#8216;Compute Using&#8217; on ID, drop the calculation “How much above the Line?” on to &#8216;Size&#8217; on the marks card (and if you want to see the label, drop a copy on to &#8216;Text&#8217; too). Then create a dual axis chart and choose from the marks card Gantt Bar for the trend line to visualise the deviation from the trend line (Fig.11).</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-11-How-much-abvove-below.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11975" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-11-How-much-abvove-below-300x265.png" alt="Fig 11 How much abvove below" width="423" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 11: Visualising distance of observation from the trend line</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Example 2: &#8220;What-If?”</span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine you would like to analyse the profitability of customers. When your company acquires a new client we&#8217;d like to evaluate what to expect based on the currently known trend. For this ‘what-if&#8217; scenario we need to create an option for the analyst to choose a value within the data set or SLIGHTLY outside (if you want to do go far beyond your own data set, better use a different method of predictive analytics).</p>
<p>As a reminder to calculate the trend line we used the formula</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LineFormula.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-11655 aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LineFormula.jpg" alt="LineFormula" width="122" height="38" /></a></p>
<p>So to answer your question we need to take three steps:</p>
<p>a) extract the constants</p>
<p>Intercept:   <span style="color: #0000ff;">SCRIPT_REAL</span>( &#8220;<span style="color: #0000ff;">lm</span>( .arg2 ~ .arg1) $coefficients[1]&#8221; , <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #ff6600;">[x]</span>), <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #ff6600;">[y]</span>))</p>
<p>Slope:         <span style="color: #0000ff;">SCRIPT_REAL</span>( &#8220;<span style="color: #0000ff;">lm</span>( .arg2 ~ .arg1) $coefficients[2]&#8221; , <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #ff6600;">[x]</span>), <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #ff6600;">[y]</span>))</p>
<p>b) we have to replace our known x-values from the data set with values the analyst can choose from. To do so create a parameter (Fig. 12) , which is then called in the trend line calculation replacing <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>([<span style="color: #ff6600;">x</span>]) with <span style="color: #0000ff;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #993366;">[Parameter]</span>).</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-12-What-if-x-Value-Parameter.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11978" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-12-What-if-x-Value-Parameter-300x253.jpg" alt="Fig 12 What if x Value Parameter" width="347" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 12: Create Parameter &#8220;What-If x-Value&#8221;</p>
<p>c) Finally, we want to see only ONE estimated value, not all the possible values. In other words we need to filter the returned y-values and the easiest way is to use the function <span style="color: #0000ff;">First</span>().</p>
<p>Piecing these three steps together the new &#8220;R What-If Trend Line (What if)&#8221; calculation reads then like</p>
<p>If <span style="color: #0000ff;">FIRST</span>() = 0 Then <span style="color: #0000ff;">INT</span>((<span style="color: #ff6600;"> [R slope]</span> * <span style="color: #ff6600;">[x(what if)]</span> ) + <span style="color: #ff6600;">[R intercept]</span> ) END.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-13-R-What-If.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12044" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fig-13-R-What-If-300x251.jpg" alt="Fig 13 R What If" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>

<p>HAPPY ANALYSING!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, drawing some circular inspiration from the front cover of David McCandless&#8217; <em>Information Is Beautiful</em>, I&#8217;m going to take a simple bar chart and wrap it around a circle, for no other reason than to see if it can be done in Tableau. You can argue amongst yourselves as to whether this is a good/meaningful visualisation, but it&#8217;s a pretty little thing and has a few nice tricks in it so read it for its educational value rather than an integral part of your next client&#8217;s dashboard.</p>
<p><span id="more-9389"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Chart<br />
</strong><br />
We&#8217;re going to end up with something a bit like this. The finished visualisation is at the end of the post, complete with a few parameters to let you alter the appearance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/radial-graphic.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview<br />
</strong></p>
<p>We will be using Tableau&#8217;s line drawing capabilities to draw our graph, so we will need two points for each bar, one positioned on an inner circle and one extending outwards along the same angle. Once we&#8217;ve worked out an angle for each of our bars we just dig out some school geometry to break that down into an X,Y plot and we&#8217;re pretty much done.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121913_1334_Itsyourroun1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Drawing the green bar requires us to know the two radii and the angle on which the bar is projected.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: The Data</strong></p>
<p>Normally on a scatter plot you are only plotting individual marks, so you have one row of data per point. However we need two points to define the line so we need to do a bit of work on the data connection. To do this we will use a UNION query to create a second version of the data. In order to keep the field calculations the same the second query will have a few strategically placed zeroes and will introduce a field called PathOrder which will be either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether it represents the start or the end of our lines. We will be using a cut down set of fields from the Sample Superstore (Subset) data source that comes with Tableau.</p>
<p>Connect to the Superstore Sales Subset excel spreadsheet and then use a Custom SQL connection as follows:</p>
<p><code>SELECT [Orders$].[Product Category] AS [Category],<br />
[Orders$].[Product Name] AS [Item],<br />
[Orders$].[Profit] AS [Profit],<br />
[Orders$].[Row ID] AS [Row ID],<br />
[Orders$].[Sales] AS [Sales],<br />
1 AS PathOrder<br />
FROM [Orders$]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT [Orders$].[Product Category] AS [Category],<br />
[Orders$].[Product Name] AS [Item],<br />
0 AS [Profit],<br />
[Orders$].[Row ID] AS [Row ID],<br />
0 AS [Sales],<br />
0 AS PathOrder<br />
FROM [Orders$]</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Table Calcs for Angles and Lengths<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The first thing we are going to do is to work out the angle for each bar, and then work out a normalised length for each bar. We used a normalised length to make it easier to specify the size of the internal circle and allow us to fix our axes on the final chart. For the angle we should know that there are <em>2π</em> radians in a full circle (360 degrees if that&#8217;s your thing). For the normalised length we are going to make the outer circle radius for the largest bar in the dataset equal to 1, so that means that each bar is going to be a fraction of the length between the two circles i.e. r2-r1</p>
<p>In my worksheet I am going to make the size of the internal circle a parameter called RADIAL_INNER set to 0.2 and the outer circle for the largest bar will be set to 1. I&#8217;m from a coding background though and don&#8217;t like &#8220;magic numbers&#8221; in code, so I&#8217;ll use a parameter called RADIAL_OUTER and set that to 1. With good naming conventions you can often get code to self-comment, and it gives you more flexibility if you ever wanted to change the value later.</p>
<p>Here are the calculated fields we need to create<br />
<code><br />
RADIAL_FIELD:<br />
[Sales]</code></p>
<p>RADIAL_ANGLE:<br />
(INDEX()-1) * (1/WINDOW_COUNT(COUNT([RADIAL_FIELD]))) * 2 * PI()</p>
<p>RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH:<br />
[RADIAL_INNER]<br />
+ IIF(ATTR([PathOrder]) = 0 , 0 ,<br />
SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])/WINDOW_MAX(SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])) * ([RADIAL_OUTER]-[RADIAL_INNER]))</p>
<p>RADIAL_X<br />
[RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH] * COS([RADIAL_ANGLE])</p>
<p>RADIAL_Y<br />
[RADIAL_NORMALISED_LENGTH] * SIN([RADIAL_ANGLE])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Plotting the Cartesian Coordinates<br />
</strong></p>
<p>We are going to have our chart sorted by Category and then by Item so we need to create a combined field. Click Category then Ctrl+Click Item and right-click and select Combine Fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add RADIAL_X to Columns</li>
<li>Add RADIAL_Y to Rows</li>
<li>Select Line as the mark type on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add Category to Colour on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add our Combined Category&amp;Item field to Detail on the Marks card</li>
<li>Add PathOrder to Path on the Marks card</li>
<li>For RADIAL_X and RADIAL_Y set the table calc to Compute By Category&amp;Item</li>
<li>Edit each axis so that its range is fixed from -1 to 1</li>
<li>Format grid lines and axes as you wish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Labelling and Parameters<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Now we have our chart, the values are not as useful to the user as they have been normalised to help us set the inner circle, so we need the field labels on there (both on the chart and on the tooltips). If you drag the RADIAL_FIELD to Label on the marks card you will see that some labels for the 0 points appear inside the circle, to stop this from happening we create a calculated field that only shows labels above a certain threshold, which I will add using a parameter so it can be changed on dashboards as well as making the table calc self-comment<br />
<code><br />
RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL:<br />
IIF(SUM([RADIAL_FIELD])&gt;[RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL_THRESHOLD], SUM([RADIAL_FIELD]), NULL)<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now all we need to do is put it on a dashboard and set up our parameters to let the user customise the graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the RADIAL_INNER parameter to have a Range of Allowable values from 0 to 1 step 0.1</li>
<li>Set the RADIAL_SELECTIVE_LABEL_THRESHOLD to 100000</li>
<li>Create a parameter RADIAL_FIELD_USE with available values &#8216;SALES&#8217;, &#8216;PROFIT&#8217;</li>
<li>Edit the RADIAL_FIELD calc to:<br />
<code>CASE [RADIAL_FIELD_USE] WHEN "Sales" THEN [Sales] WHEN "Profit" THEN [Profit] END</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Whilst it may not be the most informative of views it is a good example of how you can make Tableau draw visualisations that are a little out of the ordinary. Like I said at the beginning, sometimes you do things just to see if you can, so here&#8217;s the viz to prove it can be done!

<p dir="ltr">To amend a colour in Tableau Desktop you can double click on a colour on the colour legend itself. This pops up the standard select a colour menu. If you now double click on the blue square next to a category, BBC 1 in this example, you can customise the colour by choosing a different colour, amending the gradient or by specifying an RGB code.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8695" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC2-300x235.png" alt="BBC2" width="300" height="235" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The website <a title="Colour Lovers" href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/410981/BBC_World" target="_blank">colourlovers.com</a> allows users to store custom colour palettes. I am using the BBC Worldwide Colour Palette in this example.</p>
<p>If we look at the colour we can see it has an RGB of 184, 31, 30.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC6.png"><img src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC6-300x152.png" alt="BBC6" width="300" height="152" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">If we enter this into the cusom colour menu on Tableau and click OK we can assign this shade of red to BBC. Repeating this for each channel will give it a BBC ‘branded’ look.</p>
<p><script src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>

</div>
<p dir="ltr">This works fine for a one off chart, however it would be a laborious task if it were carried out on every visualisation built at the company. Whilst not available through the front end, Tableau does allow for the creation of additional custom colour palettes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To do this you need to amend the Preferences.tps file which can be located in the ‘My Tableau Repository Folder’. The repository is by default found within the My Documents folder on a Tableau Desktop user&#8217;s machine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Navigate to the Repository and right click on the preferences file. You can open the file in Notepad or any other text editor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The file uses a standard xml format. To add a colour palette you can use the following syntax:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&lt;preferences&gt;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>       &lt;color-palette name=&#8221;BBC Colour Scheme&#8221; type=&#8221;regular&#8221; &gt;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>               &lt;color&gt;#B81F1E&lt;/color&gt;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>          &lt;/color-palette&gt;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&lt;/preferences&gt;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Each color needs to be entered within the &#8216;Color-palette&#8217; section. Unlike Desktop this uses HTML Hex Codes. Each code needs to be prefixed with a #.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The completed file for the BBC palette looks like this:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC13.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8684" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC13-300x114.png" alt="BBC13" width="300" height="114" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you have entered each of your colours you can save the preferences file. You will need to close and reopen Tableau for the new preferences to load.<br />
Now if you go to edit colours you will see a new colour palette listed in the dropdown with the colours you have just specified.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC9.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8688" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BBC9.png" alt="BBC9" width="192" height="190" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The preferences file will need to be installed on all local machines for users to be able to use the palette during design. The colours will still appear on the visualisation if loaded on another machine but the palette will not be available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Did you know that Microsoft Paint allows you to get the RGB for any pixel on an image? Simply load or paste an image in MS Paint and use the Colour picker (it looks like an eye dropper) to select a pixel and then choose &#8216;Edit colors&#8217; which is right most on the toolbar to reveal the RGB codes for the selected colour.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been much interesting debate about David McCandless’ <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information Is Beautiful</a> this week, initiated by a <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=935">well written critical piece</a> by Stephen Few. I am pleased he has challenged the orthodox view that McCandless is the answer to the data visualisation industry’s problems.</p>
<p>On both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140825034122/http://flowingdata.com:80/2011/04/17/business-intelligence-vs-infotainment/">FlowingData</a> and Stephen’s own blog, there is debate about the difference between “simple” and “simplistic” graphics. This is a hard point to describe, and there are two comments on Stephen’s blog (by DR, and Stephen himself) that made me realise that a picture would emphasise the difference. I wondered how McCandless, if the accusation of simplicity is correct, would rework what&#8217;s often claimed to be one of the greatest data visualisations.</p>
<p>Consider the classic work by Charles Minard showing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia_%281812%29">Napoleon’s disastrous 1812 march on Moscow</a>. This graphic, I believe, fits Stephen’s definition of simple. Sure, there are many dimensions being displayed (soldier numbers, temperature, location, etc) but once the viewer understands that, the powerful anti-war message is unavoidable. The waste of life is brutally clear and well contextualised by the time location and temperature:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png" alt="Minard's march on Moscow (from Wikipedia)" width="640" height="305" /></a>#</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">(image from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png)</span></a></p>
<p>If McCandless is to be accused of simplicity, how might a simplistic version look? I think it would be like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/minardSimplified2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2311" title="minardSimplified" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/minardSimplified2.png" alt="" width="500" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Why? The simplistic approach tries to strip away as much data as it can. Minard’s main point was the loss of life. The version above shows just that and no more. One could argue that therefore it is more effective. But it isn’t. Minard’s simple graph gives much more context without any fluff and that, to me, is the difference between “simple” and “simplistic”.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Fixed the spelling of David McCandless&#8217; name &#8211; sorry about the typos</p>

This post reveals how I did it. Those of you who are savvy with the new features in v6 will probably have immediately guessed it was using dual axes. Here&#8217;s what my lollipop chart looks like:</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script><object class="tableauViz" width="639" height="745" style="display:none;"><param name="name" value="lollipop/lollipopmultipledimsdb" /><param name="tabs" value="yes" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /></object><noscript>lollipop (multiple dims) (db) <br /><a href="#"><img alt="lollipop (multiple dims) (db) " src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/lo/lollipop/lollipopmultipledimsdb/1_rss.png" height="100%" /></a></noscript>
<div style="width:639px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px; color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/lollipop/lollipopmultipledimsdb" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>What&#8217;s the trick? It revolves around duplicating your measure on the columns shelf, as follows:<a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dual-axis1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2205" title="dual axis" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dual-axis1.png" alt="" width="410" height="67" /></a></p>
<p>You need to make sure it&#8217;s dual axis. Right-click on the second Measure pill and choose &#8220;Dual Axis&#8221; to draw each AVG(Satisfaction) on the same pane. Then right-click on one of the axes and choose &#8220;Synchronise axis&#8221; to make sure they match completely. This step is important because if you add labels to one of the measures, Tableau might stretch one axis to fit the text of the label in.</p>
<p>The next step is to define multiple marks. This feature might be new to you, and doesn&#8217;t exactly jump out at you in the user interface. Click on the little drop-down arrow at the right of the Marks shelf and choose &#8220;Multiple Mark Types&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/multiple-makrs1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2218" title="multiple makrs" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/multiple-makrs1.png" alt="" width="208" height="218" /> </a></p>
<p>The Mark shelf now has a new row: it will say &#8220;All&#8221; and have left/right arrows. With the multiple mark feature, you can format all measures at once, or each one individually. What we need to do is set one mark to be a bar (a very thin one) and the other to be a circle, as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/marks-design-for-lollipop2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2220" title="marks design for lollipop" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/marks-design-for-lollipop2.png" alt="" width="499" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>In my example, I have also added colour to emphasise the Customer Segment dimension. You&#8217;ll see that each Mark uses a different Dimension. While experimenting with the lollipops, I discovered that if the connecting line is the same intensity as the circle, it overwhelms the circle. By using a lighter palette on the line, things look nicer. I achieved this by duplicating the Dimension, and assigning lighter colours of the same hue to its members.</p>
<p>To label the min/max I turned on labels for just the Circle mark.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about all you need to do. I added some shading and subtle row divider lines to highlight the different states. Finally, I formatted the axes so they were pretty much hidden.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started using this technique regularly as it engages users, and improves the data-ink ratio without sacrificing interpretation. What do you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: I am visualising satisfaction rates over multiple dimensions. In almost all cases, satisfaction rates are high (between 70% and 100%). I want a visualisation that allows comparison over multiple dimensions that is also nice on the eye. Below is the result: a lollipop chart. Although I stumbled across this design by trial and error in Tableau, it is a chart type found elsewhere, eg on <a href="http://chandoo.org/wp/2010/04/09/dot-plot-panel-chart/">Chandoo&#8217;s excellent Excel blog</a>. What I thought I would do in this post is explain why I think it&#8217;s a great chart in this situation and how to do it in Tableau. <strong>Note: in this post, I&#8217;m using the Superstore data, not my real dataset. </strong>In my next post, I&#8217;ll explain how to build a lollipop in Tableau. If you can&#8217;t wait that long, you could try it yourself as your homework <img src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lollipop.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2186" title="lollipop" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lollipop.png" alt="" width="631" height="618" /></a></p>
<p><br class="spacer_" /></p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s a great way to reduce the data-ink ratio while retaining readability. What do you think? Here&#8217;s how I arrived at this design.</p>
<p>Tableau&#8217;s default visualisation is the bar. What&#8217;s the problem with this? Well, when the bars are all very long (as is the case with my data), there&#8217;s just too much ink, and it creates an unpleasant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">Moire effect</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/default-bars-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202" title="default bars (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/default-bars-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>How can we solve this? Well, we can reduce the bars to wafer thin ones, but this looks, well, flakey:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thin-lines-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2201" title="thin lines (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thin-lines-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe we should push the size slider to the max (and add a border). This is what I would normally do in this situation. It removes the Moire effect, and isn&#8217;t too bad, but boy, there&#8217;s now a lot of ink being used:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/fat-bars-and-borders-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2200" title="fat bars and borders (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/fat-bars-and-borders-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Given there&#8217;s too much ink, maybe the bar itself is the problem. So how does a circle work? Well, the problem is that the circle is a long long way away from the label. When we try and foist this kind of thing on our users, they tell us it&#8217;s too hard to relate the circle to the name, even using shaded lines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2199" title="circle (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>We can get round this distance problem in a couple of ways. One is to fix the axis so that it&#8217;s range is only as wide as the min/max values:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-4-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2196" title="circle 4 (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-4-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>But we all know that an axis that doesn&#8217;t start at zero is a bad thing, right? Well, sometimes it isn&#8217;t a bad thing, but it sure makes the states at the bottom of the list look like poor performers, even though they&#8217;re actually only 0.6% lower than the top of the list. Best in this case to keep the axis starting at zero. Maybe we could label the circle directly instead:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-3-db.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2197" title="circle 3 (db)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/circle-3-db.png" alt="" width="495" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>This still isn&#8217;t right: all that white space at the left of the chart seems wrong.</p>
<p>And this was when I had my brainwave. Thick bars are no good and lonely circles are no good. How about making a combination of them both? And that&#8217;s how I came up with a lollipop.I think it has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Can be used when all dimension members have high values (i.e. long/tall bars in a bar chart)</li>
<li>Greatly reduces the data-ink ratio while maintaining a clear link to axis labels</li>
<li>All the users I&#8217;ve shown it to so far have really engaged with it &#8211; they think it&#8217;s both pretty and easy to read</li>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>I also like the fact that it works if you add more dimensions to make small multiples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lollipop-multiple-dims-db2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2194" title="lollipop (multiple dims) (db2)" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lollipop-multiple-dims-db2-292x300.png" alt="" width="292" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Next time we&#8217;ll look at how to build it in Tableau. In the meantime, let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>My session, Pie charts: good or evil, was intended to show people how poor pie charts are at representing anything other than at-a-glance information. One could argue they fail even for that. This post is a collection of resources I used for the session, in case you want to do some further reading.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get to cover some important points in the session. One common rebuttal to the argument is that you could add labels to the pie, showing the percentage. Well, yes, but that&#8217;s like admitting defeat. That is an acceptance that the chart alone does not convey the information correctly. If you need to label the slices, then surely you don&#8217;t even need the chart itself? And if that&#8217;s the case, then you&#8217;ve just proven to yourself that a ranked table of text is a better way to display the data, as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WhyLabelsFail.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2142" title="WhyLabelsFail" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WhyLabelsFail.png" alt="" width="600" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart#Use.2C_effectiveness_and_visual_perception">pie chart page now has a prominent section</a> describing why the pie is bad.</p>
<p>I also recommend Jorge Camoes&#8217; great blog. He eloquently describes the problems in at least two posts (<a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/pie-charts-a-neverending-discussion/">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-bad-chart/">this one</a>, for starters).</p>
<p>For more on the specifics of the problems with Google Analytics, visit <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2006/04/29/google-analytics-the-goggles-they-do-nothing/">Coda Hale&#8217;s blog</a>.<img class="alignright" style="float: right;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Piecharts.svg/300px-Piecharts.svg.png" alt="pie v bar" width="300" height="215" /></p>
<p>Stephen Few provides some in-depth analysis of the <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/08-21-07.pdf">problems with all things circular</a> (pdf). He also describes the significant problem with comparing relative sizes of pies, something I didn&#8217;t have time to touch upon in my session. There is a really great description of why size/area of circle is a poor choice at Contrast&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>If you want to find some bad examples of pies, well, that&#8217;s like shooting fish in a barrel. Here&#8217;s just a few:</p>
<p>The Breakdown of the blogosphere. Six variations on the pie chart. None of them any use. EagerEyes features this infographic in his excellent <a href="http://eagereyes.org/criticism/march-chart-madness">March Chart Madness</a> post.</p>
<p>I did mention there are some reasons a pie might be a good option. There are at least a couple. If you specifcally need to compare several dimension members against other dimension members, a bar chart doesn&#8217;t make that easy. If your pie chart is going to seen for a short period of time, such as during a presentation, <em>and</em> it only has a 3 or fewer slices, then a pie can make a point quickly. In this latter case, don&#8217;t put the pie in the handouts &#8211; give the user more info with a table or bar chart.</p>
<p>Finally, here are my slides. I&#8217;m not sure how useful they are without my words, mind:</p>
