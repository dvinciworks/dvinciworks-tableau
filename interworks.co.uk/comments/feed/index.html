		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bhushan, 

Yes it is quite involved. I regard this as an example of what is possible in Tableau not necessarily what you should do. There are much better ways of displaying this type of data.
I have updated the post with an image as requested. I hope that helps and good luck with your visualisation.

		<description><![CDATA[This is quite an involved procedure; why isn&#039;t this chart type supported in TAbleau? Doing this lengthy procedure defeats the purpose of using Teableau for &quot;QUICK&quot; analysis and vizualiation.

Where to enter the Tableau Custom SQL (found in the edit connection window): Hwere is this edit connection window? Can you please include some images showing where to enter?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nishant
There are no changes in permissions in Tableau 9, and permissions don&#039;t change as part of the upgrade from 8 to 9.
Is this change affecting just one person or everyone?
If it is just one person, I would take a look at the person&#039;s permissions and ensure that they have Web Editing rights for that project.
If it is everyone, I would check the Server settings to ensure that Web Authoring is enabled for that site. (This is under settings)
Hope that this helps 
Glen]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Glen,
Thanks for summarizing all the changes from admin&#039;s point of view. Is there any changes from permissions aspect as well. One of the user in my organization is unable to create new workbook in tableau 9 server from existing data source whereas he used to create new workbook from same datasource in tableau 8.

Do you have any clue how is that possible?

Thanks,
Nishant]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark, Sorry to hear that you&#039;ve seen issues with the upgrade to v9. Have you compared a performance recording of v8 and v9 to try to tie down the cause and are you seeing this sort of performance on all dashboards, or just one? When you hear from Tableau, I would be interested in any feedback you get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish we&#039;d had the same experience :(

our experience, using Tableau against an Analysis Services datasource, was a 4 fold DECREASE in performance, with the slowest query going from .44 seconds to 8.5 

I do have a bug logged with them, and hopefully we&#039;ll get better, but we were hoping for more speed not less!]]></description>
