		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

Whilst I&#039;ll miss your blog posts, it&#039;ll be great that we continue to work together in one form or another.  Tableau did well getting you onto their team.

It&#039;s been fun bantering about who had the 1st user group meeting, but either way, both of our group are seen as the standard bearers for groups around the world.  ATUG continues to meet monthly and we&#039;ve yet to run out of content (touch wood!).  Thank you for presenting to our group today. 

Best of luck!
Andy K]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although you&#039;re leaving the Data Studio, I hope you continue to share your Tableau experiments and expertise through another medium!

Maybe we&#039;ll see it in the forums? Or perhaps you&#039;ll revive your other blog? Either way, don&#039;t go silent on us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy,
I hope you leaving the User side of Tableau does not mean &quot;The King is dead”. But it means &quot;Long live the King&quot; for you are truly a person held in high regard by the TS users. Joining Camelot and taking your seat at the round table only seems like a natural way of progression.

I wish you all the best and I&#039;m sure you will keep blogging you seem to have the bug.

See you in LasVegas

I wish you the absolute best of luck with your new role and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be very successful!
Tableau know a good thing when they see it, and they&#039;ve made the right decision to bring you aboard as the &#039;voice&#039; for the users.
Best of luck and I hope to see you soon,
