		<description><![CDATA[Hi Welton,

At the bottom of the visualisation you can click the download button to get the Venn workbook. I have made it float by making sure it is plotted on 2 axis rather than 1.  I have also clicked the floating option from the carat menu in the top right of the worksheet when viewed on the dashboard.

Good Luck]]></description>

Thanks for the analysis, but, please, could you send me a file where I can visualize the &quot;trick&quot; to make bubbles float?

Thank you]]></description>
