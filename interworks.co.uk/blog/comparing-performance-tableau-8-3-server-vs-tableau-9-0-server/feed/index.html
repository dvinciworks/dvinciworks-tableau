		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark, Sorry to hear that you&#039;ve seen issues with the upgrade to v9. Have you compared a performance recording of v8 and v9 to try to tie down the cause and are you seeing this sort of performance on all dashboards, or just one? When you hear from Tableau, I would be interested in any feedback you get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish we&#039;d had the same experience :(

our experience, using Tableau against an Analysis Services datasource, was a 4 fold DECREASE in performance, with the slowest query going from .44 seconds to 8.5 

I do have a bug logged with them, and hopefully we&#039;ll get better, but we were hoping for more speed not less!]]></description>
