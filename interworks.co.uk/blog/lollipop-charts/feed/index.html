		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

It doesn&#039;t tell you a great deal about the wider trends/chronology, but I guess it does show where the current value sits in relation to prior values - an indication of the range involved. For example in the one I&#039;ve done you can see the majority of them are pretty stable over time - Germany especially so, whilst Italy is clearly declining. You&#039;d probably not chose it where the time was critical, but I think it does add something...

Cheers,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi David
Good stuff. I was pretty sure it would turn out to be something other than just page history causing the crash. The workbook I am working on for real has some pretty complex calculated fields going on - it doesn&#039;t surprise me something breaks along the way...

Anyway, now we&#039;ve all established you can show page history with a lollipop, does it help the analytics? I&#039;m not sure - it&#039;s very hard to see the trend of the recent values, whether they are up or down. Maybe with some more configuration of the Page History formats that could be enhanced, but I think it would quite a challenge. I do have a viz technique called Dribble Charts that I was shown by @aknock that I keep meaning to blog about. It incorporates size into the history, and does show trends over time very well when you are ranking data as in the example above.

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

Neat idea.

When we did the page history feature, we knew it wouldn&#039;t work as for bar charts as some other chart types, but I think it might work quite well with lollipops. I&#039;d be interested to hear what you think.
