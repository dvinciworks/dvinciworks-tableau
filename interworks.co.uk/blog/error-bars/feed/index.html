		<description><![CDATA[That is a nice solution for what I think should be a built-in feature... Don&#039;t understand why calculating error on a data set is not something more people have requested!

My problem is that some of my bar charts are already aggregate functions, and I like that because they can be updated for different filters, people, etc.  The graph is a simple two-bin bar chart for different dates that can be filtered by all people who contributed data or any subset.

Challenge:
How can you have error bars be calculated for each filter?  I can&#039;t hardwire the std error for every possible permutation of date/person (I could but I would rather not spend my time that way).]]></description>
