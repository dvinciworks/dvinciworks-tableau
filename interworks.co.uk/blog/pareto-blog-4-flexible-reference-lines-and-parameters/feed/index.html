		<description><![CDATA[What a great question!

The Pareto chart here requires all data points to be in the visual in order to run a series of tableau calculations to return the 80% intersection. To render a line chart in Tableau you would need all the data points for each week. This would be a major drain on Tableaus processing and would likely be very slow. 

The way I have displayed this before is to have a number of Paretos on the same page, in your scenario maybe 4 for four weeks ago, three weeks ago, last week and current week. Allowing you to see the changes. With a little coding you should be able to just get the numbers and put these above your Pareto Chart. I will take a look at this myself and see if I can product an example. 

The most efficient way to get this data however would be to duplicate the calculation in the source database at week level and then load the results into a table containing only date and the intersect number. This would allow you to plot your line chart and be fast for the end user.]]></description>

Am I able to add a Line Chart with the temporal serie of the Intersection; i.e., the weekly progress of my pareto number?]]></description>
