		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

I&#039;ve been thinking about related issues for the last couple of months and finally got off my duff and wrote something about it.

		<description><![CDATA[Andy makes a key point here I think. All of us in this field want to be supportive so we all run the risk of only every hearing praise for our work (which is lovely) but this means we&#039;ll seldom hear anything which might advance our skills or broaden our awareness of possibly equally valid approaches.

I believe many people are open to the idea of actively offering work up for critique in the interest of hearing balanced and constructive suggestions on how they feel that visualisation might be produced. 

I also believe that there are those who are prepared to take time out to offer their opinions on work that has been submitted. As Andy said, I think many of us would be just as nervous being critics that we offer opinion as just that: opinion. It&#039;s not right or wrong - just opinion offered up with the same respect and humility as the person submitting the work in the first place.

Perhaps the bright and shiny world of Google+ would provide the most straightforward way for this to be done?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark Twain once said advice is like the time on your wristwatch: Offer it when it&#039;s asked for.

But I&#039;d say as an expert, you can also go a bit farther with this; when criticism becomes simply a matter of taste, you might want to let it slide.  When it comes to matters of functionality, you should chime in.  I think this is because people who use Tableau are inherently looking for &quot;better.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

Very &quot;nice&quot; blog post.  However ...

Looking forward to taking in your presentation at TCC2011, and offering a kindly worded critique, though it will be difficult to find the right words.

One other &quot;why is that&quot; that I think is worth exploring, as well as coming up with a way to work it through, is this: there are likely many Tableau practitioners/experts in the wild who are not at liberty because of their employment situations, to share their excellent work or provide public comment on the work of others.  In fact, I know some very good practitioners who are generally not at liberty to disclose which analytics tools they use in their work, Tableau or otherwise.  

It is a supreme blessing for them and for those among us who can be more revealing, that you and Richard Leeke and Joe Mako, and Steve Wexler, are able to devote so much energy to the good of the whole.

Kudos, kudos, many thanks, and as always,

MANY BLESSINGS!
Peace and All Good!

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no tableau expert, but as with photos, there&#039;s a way to constructively criticise positively - though I appreciate its hard. Maybe not criticise the existing layout, but emphasise what a change might positively bring.

But as with photos, different people see different things in visualisations, and you have to be sure that your proposed change enhances what their original aim was in visualising. Certainly groups exist for photo critique all around the web with the aim of improving the submitter&#039;s knowledge by gathering different perspectives, but that&#039;s an opt in thing, rather than unsolicited.

If you feel uncomfortable directly critiquing people&#039;s tableau work, one option would be to setup a group that people can submit to for active positive critique - thus you get to advise and people actively want to improve and receive criticism.]]></description>
