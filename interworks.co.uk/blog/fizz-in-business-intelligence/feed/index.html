		<description><![CDATA[A big thank you to everybody who took the time and effort to enter the competition. We&#039;ve agonised over all of the suggestions above and we&#039;ve picked a winner.

Drum roll, please, and congratulations to John Stevens-Taylor for his entry:

“We take raw incomprehensible data and expose the beautiful patterns in the information within, allowing people and businesses to make informed and meaningful decisions.”

A very well shaken (not stirred) bottle of Dom Perignon is on its way to him. We really liked Greg&#039;s entry too, so there&#039;s a nice bottle of Malbec being lined up as a second prize for him.

Many thanks again and let&#039;s continue enjoying Business Intelligence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mel, when I find difficult to understand or to explain things I prefer to make comparisons with real world&#039;s things that I comprehend and the way you related Champagne and BI seems not to be a simple coincidence. In a party BI can be compared with this champagne to make it easier to understand; this is why:

* You are making business in a hard market (Let&#039;s say you are a young single man in a crazy party)
- Both are not cheap, but the benefits can be huge
- Both can give you some status
- Clients (let&#039;s say girls) can be interested in share market knowledge (let&#039;s say the champagne)
- Competence (let&#039;s say other men) might be fearful, because your chances to win clients, are better
- You can feel fine sharing your market knowledge (let&#039;s say champagne) with your partners (let&#039;s say friends)
- If you can&#039;t buy a champagne (let&#039;s say to have a BI development) you can buy it tomorrow, but your chances can be smaller&#039;s compared with the competence.
- If you don&#039;t know how to use it, you can fail in your business (let&#039;s say you can be seen as a fool)
- The size of the BI development (let&#039;s say the champagne) must be in agreement with your organization, if not, you can fail in your business (let&#039;s say You can go broke)
- You can see the market from another perspective (let&#039;s say you can have a new kind of fun) 

* Finally, do you want to have a BI development? (let&#039;s say; do you want to drink a champagne with me?)

This isn&#039;t a formal BI definition, but when you don&#039;t know how to explain it or the partners don&#039;t understand, I hope this little comparison can be useful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mel,

I&#039;ve found that either people have a (bad) preconception of BI, or have never heard of it.
The elevators in my building are a bit slower, I reckon I could get out this pitch:

&quot;Our job is to help you find the nuggets of truth buried in the mountains of information stored within your organisation.

By exploring this information visually, we can quickly navigate to points of interest to uncover these bits of knowledge, that would otherwise remain hidden.

We use Visual Analytics to produce intuitive, interactive visualisations of your organisation&#039;s data that allow you to easily uncover trends, relationships, contributing factors and exception cases.

The result is you can uncover the real story from your data and use it to make more informed business decisions; allowing you to not only work more efficiently, but also to spot problems and opportunities.&quot;

Good luck finding your perfect pitch!
