He is a pop star, who happens to be focussed on the area of graphics rather than music. The Beatles might be musical candy in comparison to say, Michael Tippett, but it is Paul McCartney who owns the Mull of Kintyre.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A chart is not neutral, a chart is an argument, what is left out is not Innocent, and what you choose to emphasize is a personal choice. Seth Goding, like McCandless, believes that we should remove as much data as possible.

Tufte, on the other hand, believes that more data is better. But he says &quot;to clarify, add detail&quot;, not &quot;to clarify add data&quot;. When we make a chart we must try to understand when data becomes detail and when data becomes noise. Easier said than done.]]></description>
