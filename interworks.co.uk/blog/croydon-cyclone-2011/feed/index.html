		<description><![CDATA[Ah, Joe, you pointed out something I hadn&#039;t even noticed. What I&#039;ve done is shockingly bad viz technique! Oops. Hopefully by the time you read this comment I will have fixed it to be more accurate with one axis. What I will do is hide the pars. 

And Steve - have you yet come up with a way of showing half the par on one side of zero and half on the other?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe,

Ah, I see your point.  Andy would need to show the pars as well but needs half of them to go to the birdies side and half to the bogies side.

We&#039;re back to discussing Likert issues again.  Joe, I think you&#039;re the fellow that hipped me to this:

http://sfew.websitetoolbox.com/post/show_single_post?pid=20887892&amp;postcount=11

At one point I added this approach to my big book of Likert scale visualizations but came to the conclusion that there were too many drawbacks to doing this with Tableau (but I&#039;ll be damned if I can remember why I scratched it as it really wasn&#039;t that hard to split the neutrals.)

		<description><![CDATA[I will provide feedback in the form of a workbook later this evening or week, but the biggest quick issue I saw was  the green &quot;13&quot; bar for hole 1 on the birdies side is about twice as big as the the ping 14 bar on hole 8. There are a few ways to address this issue, my preferred is to use a single measure pill with a formatted axis, instead of two measure pills with one revered. When you have two measure pills like you do currently, the only option is a static axis, but that generates a lot of unneeded white space.

On this view and some of the others, the lack of an axis seems to make it more difficult for me to parse the information. For example on the &quot;Holes and pars&quot; sheet, I have to guess is the axis % of total for the division or the count.

Thankfully this is on Tableau Public, and I am able to remix it and create views that enable me to answer my own questions. Thank you for this Andy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

The analysis on this I think is spot on and I really like the Cyclone viz to show just how hard the course is.

Two thoughts:

1)  Why use red and green as contrasting colors?  You know my take on this and the color-blind simulator I use.  That said, the cyclone is so clear that you could use the same color and it would still be easy to read.

2)  I find the resizing of the top viz to make room for a second viz when you select a whole a little jarring, but that could just be me.  Cool technique.

Very good work indeed.
