		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comment Jerome, you raise a fair point. 

I think it is important to point out that the two options to create calculations and calculated fields are not mutually exclusive. Those who do not yet feel at ease with using the new feature can still rely on the editor to highlight errors in one&#039;s formula, whereas those who are fluent in Tableau have at their disposal a new and easy way to quickly iterate through various formulas during their analytical flow. 
Personally, I use a mix of both; Type-In Pills for rapid-fire calculations and smaller formulas, the editor for larger formulas that involve logical statements as well as a larger number of measures and dimensions.

		<description><![CDATA[Good feature but for those that are not coders it is not user friendly nor intuitive.  How do you know the calc is good or bad.  Also I found the formula errors out because I have to scroll up and down the measures shelf to find what I want to use.]]></description>
