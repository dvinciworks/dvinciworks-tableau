		<description><![CDATA[HI Ross
That&#039;s the point - even when it rains, it&#039;s mostly only for some of the day. I need to find a dataset of rainfall for Oxford and blend it to show just how many days have rain but not on my commutes.

PS - it rained on me last night. 84 commutes....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PS, I had a thought the other day. Most of the time, people quote rainfall data in days (in other words, Seattle has precipitation on 310 days of the year). Of course this does not mean it rained all day! Hence the rather small percentage of rainy commutes.

Plus, I suspect mid-late afternoon (return commutes) is probably the warmest time of the day and could have lower rainfall? That might be stretching it.

Clearly I have been on my bike too much thinking this mush over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great work Andy! I am also an avid bike commuter and although Seattle gets a nasty reputation, I would say at least 80% of my commutes are dry. The overcast, however, can be a little depressing.]]></description>
