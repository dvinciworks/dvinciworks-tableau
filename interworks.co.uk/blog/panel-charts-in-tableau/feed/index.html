		<description><![CDATA[One more follow up - Using your method, is it possible to include in each multiple / chart a trend line for the national average over time? (In your case, the avg number of sales per year for all states). 

I&#039;m thinking something similar to the light grey line in these trellis charts:

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the great tip, Andy. 

On the viz where you sort states by total sales (Panel (ordered by Measure), can you clarify where you specified that sorting should be based on total sales? By default, my viz sorts alphabetically by states, and I can&#039;t find where to have it sort by the overall sum of the measure I&#039;m working with. Nor do I see where you specified this in your viz.

It looks like your states are sorted using the calculated field, Total sales for state (i.e., WINDOW_SUM(SUM([Sales]))), but I&#039;m not so sure. When I remove this calculated field from the card, everything is still sorted as before, which makes me think the sort is based on something else (like SUM(Sales), but even then I don&#039;t see where you can specify that as the sort.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you please share a video on how to build panels? Also, I&#039;m trying to use the latitude and longitude of a calculated Zip3 so each panel of mine would have a map. I&#039;m able to get a grid but its got all the blanks in there. I&#039;m trying to figure out how to complete this as I&#039;m pretty sure this will be really useful for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe and Andy,

Both you guys are great!

Your contributions to the Tableau user community and mad Tableau skills have saved myself and many other Tableau fans countless hours of effort. I&#039;ve been wanting to create panel charts for some time now in Tableau, and a it looks like you guys have, as usual, provided a solution not just to tackle the main problem, but went ahead and added extra value to the equation. Your desire to help others by so openly sharing your work makes the world a better place.

Keep up the great work guys, and thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joe
That&#039;s a much tidier chart. The white space was a problem, and I considered trying to get around it with a dual axis/label approach, but didn&#039;t go that far in the time I had to write this post. I notice that to acheive the tidy view, you&#039;ve had to hard-code the label to year 2009. That&#039;s good for this view, but how could you do it so it works for any length of time series, and one that might change over time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andy, Thanks for putting this together.

I felt like the labeling you used added too much additional white space, so building off your work, I made:

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

The reason for my suggestion was that you called these charts &quot;panel/trellis charts&quot;. Bill Cleveland introduced trellis charts and his panels were ordered by a measure. Kelly O&#039;Day coined the term &quot;panel charts&quot; since he thought that the term trellis was trademarked; his charts are similar to Cleveland&#039;s trellis displays.
