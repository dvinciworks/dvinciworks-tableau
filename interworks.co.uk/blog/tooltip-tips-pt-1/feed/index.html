		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dymphna,

The tooltip displays additional summary data and provides a link that, in two clicks, will show you the relevant rows from the source data. Or you can build a menu filter action (or menu URL action) that takes the user to a worksheet that is built at the lowest grain of the data.

Hope this helps! Any more questions, let me know.

		<description><![CDATA[Andy, you really are taking full advantage of the Tool Tip feature.  To save space on my dashboard, I would also like to use the Tool Tip to show some extracted data from the underlying data in a table format to avoid viewers from having to click on the underlying data link.  I have a spreadsheet that lists projects for various programs and all the data pertaining to the projects (50+ columns).  On my Tableau sheet, I am just pulling the total number of projects for each program.  I would like the Tool tip to show a text table of the names of the projects and 2 other columns(Project Status, RAG status) with headers for each column.  Can you help?]]></description>
