		<description><![CDATA[Hey Andy,

This is a great post, and exactly what I&#039;m looking for. Would you mind elaborating on the first viz that you did the golfing data? I see the proper steps for the candidacy poll viz that you did, but I can&#039;t seem to figure out the golfing one.

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am working on a a Report that needs  conditional formatting by color.

For Example: I have two sets of numbers for the same measure form two different sources and I am showing the variance between the twpo sources.

Source 1 has 5200
Source 2 has 5000
Variance = 5000/5200=96%

I need a formula that says if variance =100% than [display in green font]


Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jamie
That&#039;s a good question. I hadn&#039;t considered what downloading the underlying data would be like. You&#039;re right-  no, you can&#039;t prevent those c.f. fields being in the underlying data, as far as I know.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andy,

That is outstanding. Thank you for posting that, I&#039;ve already started making use of this approach

One question: Is there a way to exclude the Conditional Dimensions when you exclude to Excel (i.e. to Crosstab)? I&#039;m guessing the answer is no, but thought I&#039;d ask.

Cheers,
Jamie]]></description>
