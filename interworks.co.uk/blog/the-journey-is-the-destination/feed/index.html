		<description><![CDATA[@Tom - we did produce a heatmap as well, using colour to show the average response score. this, too, was instrumental in our final decision - the impact was immediately obvious. The example here did not use colour because of my brief: it had to be printed out, and I can&#039;t rely on users having access to colour printers.

@Alex - you clearly read my earlier post!

@Dan - yes, I agree. Data discovery is, well, fun with Tableau. It&#039;s almost embarrassing to use that word in terms of analytics tools, but once you have a tool that enables it, playing around with data is a fantastic way to get paid!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love this andy, for me this is totally the opposite of excel and most other viz tools.  They all require that you knew what you were looking for, and how you wanted to present it, before you start.  Making this type of view impossible.

I&#039;m wondering if you could do more with the colour though.  In order to show who is &#039;winning&#039;. Perhaos if you could highlight wins by supplier one in blue, and wins by supplier two in orange, the most frequently appearing colour would suggest the overall winner.

Cheers
