		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Andy - I remembered pablo&#039;s comment and wanted to do exactly what you did - to post a comparison with linear comparison.

Though I wanted to make it with 1 dimensional lines, not thick bars - you can arrange it such way that they are very close to each other - for example one line of text underlined with the linear representation of it&#039;s impact.

Or the bar can be overlayed on the line of text - I saw something like that in a computer magazine, where numerical representations of various attributes of for example various graphic cards were shown in a table - the attributes were in fixed width columns, each number overlayed with a pastel color bar, the width of which represented percentage of the maximal value in the given column.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did a comment like that some months ago, but people (and in this case the great David McCandless) keep representing one dimension data with 2 dimension drawings: areas. I guess it is just because squares and areas loss nicer!
I is even worse when instead of rounded squares they use circles!]]></description>
