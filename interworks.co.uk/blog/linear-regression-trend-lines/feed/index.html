		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ali,

What are you trying to do with this?  (The visual is absolutely horrible to build and pretty tough to describe). 

If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://interworks.co.uk/team/james-austin/&quot; title=&quot;James Austin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me directly and let me know what version of tableau you&#039;re on and what your end goal is then I can build you something quickly enough.

Cheers

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Thank you so much for this post.  Is there anyway to better describe how to set up the parameter?  I am unable to open up your workbook because I&#039;m on an earlier version.  


Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!  You confined my conclusion by doing all this splendid work.  My conclusion was that calculating and displaying upper and lower control limits on any trend line with a non-zero slope was going to require first writing the code for the trend line rather than accessing tableau&#039;s trend lines.  I can quit searching!  You saved me a ton of time--adding UCL and LCL to your work will be a relative &quot;piece of cake&quot;.  These functions should be available for ALL of Tableau&#039;s models.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Enrique,

Sorry for the delay in answering your post.  It took a bit of thinking about!!

I&#039;ve saved an updated version with a new dashboard containing a Logarithmic curve.  Just re-download the workbook above.

To be honest though if you want to take this much further I&#039;d start looking to R for help.  Here&#039;s a great starting point.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this tutorial; it&#039;s a very convenient shortcut around to get what I hope is a default feature of tableau in next versions.

I&#039;ve been trying, though, to replicate your what-if scenario fitting a logarithmic curve instead of a linear one. At first I figured one could just replace y for ln(y) in every calculated field, but it isn&#039;t working out.

It&#039;d be great if you could find the time to help me with this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great work following this through.  Yes, that makes sense.  I only ever tried this using measures but you&#039;re right there is no reason not to use dimensions (like a date) with this too.  Thanks for the feedback, Aus]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this post, I have been trying to work with trend line parameters for a long time, so your example was very useful (it&#039;s too bad that Tableau doesn&#039;t let us access them as calculated field).

Because I was working with graphs over time and not X Y graphs, I had to adjust your formulae and thought it could be useful for later post-readers.
Instead of WINDOW_SUM(SUM(x)), use :

    WINDOW_SUM(ATTR(FLOAT([my_date_dimension]))) if you are displaying [my_date_dimension]
or
    WINDOW_SUM(ATTR(MONTH([my_date_dimension]))) if you are displaying Month Of [my_date_dimension] for instance.]]></description>
