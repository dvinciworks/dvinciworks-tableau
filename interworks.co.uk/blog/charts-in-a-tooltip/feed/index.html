		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

I reduced the length down to 50 and it worked great, thanks very much for the suggestion!

		<description><![CDATA[HI Troy
Yes, that might be your problem. You could reduce the length of the bar to 50 characters, and then change the second part of the LEFT(.... , .....) calc to:
ROUND([% coffee sales] / 2)

That way, your bars are only ever going to be a max of 50 chars. You lose some granularity this way. 

Alternatively, despite my comments above, Alex K was right - you can use Stencil font to get more space on the tooltip.

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

When you say that &quot;Tableau tooltips won’t show more than about 80 characters on a single line&quot; does that mean that if i were trying to create bar charts in my tooltips where the percentages I&#039;m trying to show were over 80% that it wouldn&#039;t work properly? I&#039;ve followed your instructions in creating them but it&#039;s not working correctly and I&#039;m wondering if this is my problem.

Thanks,
Troy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Richard
Great info - great to hear that you&#039;re getting the Stencil font to work with long strings; I&#039;ll have to try it with a different, non-Jet database. 

Storing the bar as a constant: glad to hear it works in v6. It didn&#039;t in v5, and was raised as a bug.

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool Andy.

I had a bit of a play with some of the other folks&#039; suggestions and didn&#039;t hit all the same limitations as you.  I found a pipe in the stencil font worked fine, and didn&#039;t wrap till it was over 400 characters long (in 10 point with a reasonable amount of text and a tab to the left).  It seemed to render OK for me (but maybe I&#039;m less discerning - or maybe you&#039;re talking on Public, which I didn&#039;t try).

If your datasource is Firebird it can handle substrings up to at least 400 characters.  With Jet the limit is 256 - but if you&#039;re publishing on Public you&#039;ll be in Firebird anyway.

I tried in v6 beta2 and noticed you only get that wide string error with the data engine, not if you leave it in Firebird.  Probably not the highest priority beta issue - but worth reporting if you haven&#039;t already.

But I also found that with v6 if you store the bar as a constant in a separate calculated field, rather than embedding it in each calc that works fine (i.e. it avoids the wide string error, and avoids having to embed it in every calc).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Update: the workbook above doesn&#039;t work in Beta 6 (as of 1 October). There&#039;s a &quot;Wide string&quot; error. I did a workaround where you use only 50 character strings, and take a proportion of that length. That seems okay.

I also tinkered with Alex&#039;s suggestion of using Stencil, which works really nicely. Apart from some tooltips which render the bar in random characters - not sure what&#039;s going on there!

My advice to anyone trying this technique: make sure your data works within the tooltips before releasing it to the world!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great reuse of an Excel trick. The one thing the bars in the tool tip are missing is an axis.

I found that if you lower the font size of the blocks to 6, you get thin lines between each block, and I feel that helps the readability in the absence of an axis.

I imagine this will also be useful when Tableau Calculations are available for use inside of calculated fields.]]></description>
