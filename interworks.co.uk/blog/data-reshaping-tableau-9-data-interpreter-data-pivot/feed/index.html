		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rishi,

Thanks for your comment.

I don&#039;t think it is complex at all.  I got a really good handle on it first time without having to watch any training videos, that says user friendly to me.

I think the focus in the past has been on ensuring you are able to connect to as many technologies as possible which when you look at the connectors list is really impressive.  The fact that there is now a data reshaping element to this connection I just see as a plus and I&#039;m really looking forward to the release.

Cheers

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Aus

Nice description !!  But if I talk about the competition eg: Qlik View/Sense Cross-table functionality was there from the starting. Isn&#039;t its bit late and more complex in Tableau ?
