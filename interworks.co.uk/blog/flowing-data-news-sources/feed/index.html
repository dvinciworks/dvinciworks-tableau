		<description><![CDATA[The only thing I would change is to have the y-axis, % responses set all the way to 100%. 100% is the max possible and it would better communicate the potential gain possible for each &quot;source of news&quot;. The chart in its current form makes the data feel like Television hit near its full potential in 2002.

Just a thought.]]></description>
