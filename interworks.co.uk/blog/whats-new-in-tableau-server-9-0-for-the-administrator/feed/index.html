		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nishant
There are no changes in permissions in Tableau 9, and permissions don&#039;t change as part of the upgrade from 8 to 9.
Is this change affecting just one person or everyone?
If it is just one person, I would take a look at the person&#039;s permissions and ensure that they have Web Editing rights for that project.
If it is everyone, I would check the Server settings to ensure that Web Authoring is enabled for that site. (This is under settings)
Hope that this helps

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Glen,
Thanks for summarizing all the changes from admin&#039;s point of view. Is there any changes from permissions aspect as well. One of the user in my organization is unable to create new workbook in tableau 9 server from existing data source whereas he used to create new workbook from same datasource in tableau 8.

Do you have any clue how is that possible?

Thanks,
Nishant]]></description>
