<p>I love data and I’m always searching for new ways to make more data easily accessible to the Tableau user. In this example, I’ll demonstrate how to access Internet data via a REST API. It might seem slightly complicated, but it&#8217;s actually quite easy to reproduce for your real needs. However, should you have any complex and specific needs, Interworks consultants will be happy to help… we love challenges as much as we love data!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a lot of websites providing data which you could use in your analysis (weather, stock exchange, airline traffic…). For this example we will build a visualisation based on Decaux Velib data. Velib is an automated bike rental service. Starting in Paris, it is now available in many other cities. As a Velib service user, you may be in search of an available bike around you OR in search of an available stand to return a rented bike.</p>
<p>This dashboard shows all the Velib stations in Paris; a color coding shows the availability level (of bikes or free stands). Clicking on a station will display a Google street view of the station surrounding.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the finished dashboard :</strong></p>
<p><script src="https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="width: 654px; height: 719px;"><noscript>&amp;lt;a href=&#8217;#&#8217;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt=&#8217;Velib Paris &#8216; src=&#8217;https:&amp;amp;#47;&amp;amp;#47;public.tableau.com&amp;amp;#47;static&amp;amp;#47;images&amp;amp;#47;Pa&amp;amp;#47;ParisVelibEnglish&amp;amp;#47;VelibParis&amp;amp;#47;1_rss.png&#8217; style=&#8217;border: none&#8217; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</noscript><object class="tableauViz" style="display: none;" width="654" height="719"><param name="host_url" value="https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F" /><param name="site_root" value="" /><param name="name" value="ParisVelibEnglish/VelibParis" /><param name="tabs" value="no" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /><param name="static_image" value="https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Pa/ParisVelibEnglish/VelibParis/1.png" /><param name="animate_transition" value="yes" /><param name="display_static_image" value="yes" /><param name="display_spinner" value="yes" /><param name="display_overlay" value="yes" /><param name="display_count" value="yes" /><param name="showVizHome" value="no" /><param name="showTabs" value="y" /></object></div>
<p>The steps for this example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a Python program to connect to Internet data provider and get the data via a REST API</li>
<li>The same Python program will create a Tableau data extract file containing the data in a usable format using an API provided by Tableau (Tableau Data Extract API)</li>
<li>Tableau Desktop will then be used to visualize the data from the data extract file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important: the Tableau Data Extract API only works on a Windows based PC, not on Mac.</strong></p>
<p>This example uses Python as a programming language but the same result can be achieved using C/C++ or Java.</p>
<p><strong>Things to install before we start:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tableau desktop version 8 or 9</li>
<li>Python can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a>, pick up the latest Python 2 release and install it</li>
<li>Tableau Data Extract API downloadable here: <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/data-extract-api">http://www.tableausoftware.com/data-extract-api</a>. Select 32bits or 64bits according to your Windows version. Just download the file for later use.</li>
<li>Optional: a Google Chrome application called « Postman » to verify the JSON source before using it; accessible from the Chrome Web Store here: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Register at Decaux Open data</strong></p>
<p>It is free &#8211; Decaux will give you a personal API key, which you will need to access real time data.</p>
<p>The registration process may be different for another data provider but you will end with an API key in most case.</p>
<p>Connect to this URL and follow the registration instructions: <a href="http://developer.jcdecaux.com">http://developer.jcdecaux.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Step2 (optional but safer): Test your connection/key</strong></p>
<p>From Google Chrome, launch the Postman application, enter the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/stations?apiKey=enter_your_API_key_here">https://api.jcdecaux.com/vls/v1/stations?apiKey=enter_your_API_key_here</a></p>
<p>and click on “Send”; you should get a result like this, displaying the data in a JSON format :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postman.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11361" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/postman-287x300.png" alt="postman" width="287" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The available data is displayed in JSON format; note that “lat” and “lng” are part of a group called “position”, this is important when referencing a data in the Python script.</p>
<p>Now we know the API key is valid and we have a good view of the provided data structure</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Python modules</strong></p>
<p>Python comes with a set of standard modules (equivalent to functions or procedures) and additional modules can be added by installing them to an existing Python installation.</p>
<p>3.1/ Download the Tableau Data Extract API for Python (download link provided in the prerequisite part of this document) and install it within Python 2.7</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading the zip file, unzip it to the “&lt;python installation directory&gt;\Lib” directory</li>
<li>Open a command line window (cmd.exe)</li>
<li><em>cd &lt;python installation directory&gt;\Lib\DataExtract-xxx</em> (created by the unzip)</li>
<li><em>python setup.py install</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2/ The program also needs an optional Python module (called requests) to be installed (no need to download it):</p>
<ul>
<li>open a command line window (cmd.exe)</li>
<li><em>cd &lt;python installation directory&gt;\Scripts</em></li>
<li><em>pip install requests</em> (this will download and install the module)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: The Python script</strong></p>
<p>The Python script (.py file to be extracted from the attached zip file) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect to the Decaux Open Data website</li>
<li>Read information for Paris bike rental stations</li>
<li>Create a Tableau Extract called velib.tde</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modify the script to insert your Decaux API key where indicated, on line 40, before using it.</p>
<p>The script contains descriptions of the different tasks.</p>
<p>To launch the script, use the following Windows command line:</p>
<p><em>&lt;python installation directory&gt;\Python &lt;script directory&gt;\velib.py</em></p>
<p>This will create the tableau Extract in the script directory; should you need the extract to be created elsewhere, modify the script where indicated (line 12).</p>
<p>Important: this script doesn’t update an existing extract file but deletes/recreates it. If your Tableau dashboard accessing this extract is open, the process will fail; close Tableau and re-launch the Python script.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Velib.zip">Use this link to download the sample files</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Tableau Desktop</strong></p>
<p>The attached example is a workbook that reads data from the extract; be sure to download it in the directory containing the data extract file or modify the data source to point to a different directory.</p>
<p>You can select to visualise either the available bikes or the free stands in the stations to return a bike; a color-coding shows the availability level.</p>
<p>Hover over a station will display, in a tooltip, the station address and the number of bikes/stands. Clicking on a station will display a Google Street View of the station address.</p>
<p>Embedding Street View into Tableau will be the topics of a future blog post…</p>

<p>At Criteo, everything seems to be measured in billions. Last year, the company generated 741 billion ads; reaching 1 billion Internet users with targeted ads and acquiring $19 billion in post-click sales.</p>
<p>It’s not just the statistics that are massive. With over 60 analysts, their Business Intelligence team is also pretty huge. Needing a tool which would enable them to easily extract and explore this data quickly led them to Tableau. The analysts now use Tableau Desktop to publish dashboards to the business and thanks to Server, 800 business users are now able to access and interact with the thousands of dashboards created every year.</p>
<p>In 2012, a study was launched to select the best tools to use in its new BI system. In the selection, Criteo decided:</p>
<ul>
<li>To use Hadoop to store raw data</li>
<li>To use HP Vertica database for data warehousing</li>
<li>To use Tableau as the front end data analysis and reporting tool</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with Tableau as the chosen tool, all Criteo needed was help in implementing it. InterWorks, being a Tableau Gold Partner, were soon selected and brought Tableau expertise to Criteo teams in two areas:</p>
<p><b>Technical expertise:</b></p>
<p>With a thousand users (up to 300 simultaneously during peak periods), the right setup and optimisation of Tableau server was critical to ensure the best possible performance. François Jehl, in charge of analytics infrastructure, says “the help of InterWorks has been instrumental. They enabled us to define architecture for the highest performance. They have also helped us set up our procedures and create our own tools to operate with Tableau Server”.</p>
<p><b>User training and coaching:</b></p>
<p>InterWorks organised a first level of training with Criteo, to teach the basics of Tableau. This was shortly followed by customised workshops, to help the developers with their very specific needs. InterWorks went on to facilitate numerous onsite sessions in Paris, New York, Munich, London and Tokyo. Patrice Chaperon, central BI team manager in charge of data analysis says, “InterWorks helped our teams make the best possible use of Tableau and have largely contributed in defining our best practices. The internal post-training evaluations have always been excellent”.</p>
