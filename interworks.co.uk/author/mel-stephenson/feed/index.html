				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many times in history one person&#8217;s valuable contribution ends up being eclipsed by another for no good or fair reason.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo</a>, who was not (and never claimed to be) the inventor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope" target="_blank">refracting telescope</a> &#8211; it was invented by Dutch spectacle makers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a> is usually held out as the father of calculus but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz" target="_blank">Leibniz</a> had a similar method developed at much the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy" target="_blank">time</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" target="_blank">Charles Darwin</a>&#8216;s &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" target="_blank">On The Origin of Species</a>&#8216; lays the basis for Darwin&#8217;s position as the discoverer of evolution but of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace" target="_blank">Alfred Wallace</a> independently conceived of the same theory and was jointly published with Darwin&#8217;s writings in 1858. Yet, like so many others, this contribution seems to have been eclipsed by that of Darwin over the years.</p>
<p>Even in the world of data visualisation such errors abound. Some believe that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_nightingale" target="_blank">Florence Nightingale</a> developed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart" target="_blank">pie chart</a> when most know that it was first developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair">William Playfair</a> in his Statistical Breviary of 1801.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10274" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/burrito-on-wikipedia.png" alt="burrito on wikipedia" width="600" height="587" /></p>
<p>I feel I must alert you passionate visualisers of data to another travesty of chart type under our very noses. Recent research has led me to uncover the <strong><a href="http://trusted.interworks.co.uk/burrito/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></strong> page above lying dusty and unread which explains the true origin of what we have come to call the pareto chart. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Ada Lovelace</a>&#8216;s contribution to Babbage&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Analytical Engine</a> we need the community to rise up and right this wrong and ensure that this contribution to a fabulous chart type is not overshadowed by the mere coincidence of some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto" target="_blank">Italian mathematician</a> happening to have a similar sounding name &#8211; it&#8217;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_series" target="_blank">Fibonacci series</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Tweet. Shout. Lobby Wikipedia. Tut loudly within ear shot of two or more other people. Write to your local government data visualisation representative. Tut again if you have to. Go without sugar in your tea to show solidarity. Whatever it takes to get this travesty addressed.</p>
<p>Use this hashtag #ConsuelaCatalinaAlejandraCortezdeSantiagodeCompostelaSemi-freddo(thethird)inventedtheburritochart or #isayburrito</p>
<p>Ay Thank yew &#8211; collapses exhausted</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>LONDON, UK</strong> – InterWorks, a global leader in technology consulting, is expanding to meet the growing demand for high-quality business intelligence services in the United Kingdom and Europe by incorporating the experienced team from The Data Studio.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Under the leadership of Mel Stephenson, The Data Studio has been at the forefront of business intelligence consulting and training in the UK since 2010. Achieving the status of Tableau Silver Partner, The Data Studio championed Tableau Software by serving such notable clients as Honda, Skype and Accenture. Mr. Stephenson will<em> </em>continue his exemplary leadership as Managing Director of the InterWorks Europe office.<em> </em></p>
<p>“We are delighted to be joining forces with a world-class business intelligence and analytics company such as InterWorks.” Stephenson continues, “We&#8217;re confident that the increased depth of skills that come from this merger will further improve the great offering that our two companies offered clients before.”</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/blog/interworks-and-the-data-studio-join-forces-to-expand-global-reach/attachment/interworks-team-photo-san-diego-2012/" rel="attachment wp-att-5584"><img class="alignright" alt="InterWorks Team Photo San Diego 2012" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/InterWorks-Team-Photo-San-Diego-2012-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" /></a>Based near London, the InterWorks Europe office will not only serve the UK but will offer additional coverage to InterWorks’ existing European team in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. With the added value of being a full-service I.T. solutions provider, InterWorks Europe will tackle any data need with rapid results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tableau Customer Conference is always fantastic.</p>
<p>We always tell our customers that if they can spare the time and budget then they&#8217;ve got to go. How good are they? They&#8217;re so good this will be my fifth Tableau conference in a row!</p>
<p>This year promises to be as great as ever with customer stories that are always stimulating and thought-provoking. Everyone I know has left each Tableau conference excited about data, inspired by Tableau and energised by the infectious enthusiasm of each <a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/statwars-logo-on-shirt-yoda1.jpg" target="_blank">Tableau Wan Kenobi</a> they met.</p>
<p>After all those great sessions you&#8217;ll want to share a little of beautiful Barcelona with those people. Luckily, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/107015847631643794739/about" target="_blank">+Andy Cotgreave</a> (@acotgreave) is here to inform in classic Tableau style with an interactive guide to a little of Barcelona&#8217;s nightlife.</p>
<p>Enjoy the viz. Use it wisely. And we look forward to seeing you there!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tableau&#8217;s second European conference is fast approaching (for full details click here). I cannot recommend these conferences highly enough. Tableau&#8217;s organisation at these events is faultless and the speakers are inspirational.</p>
<p>The conference is also a great opportunity to meet other fellow Tableau evangelists and see how they are putting Tableau to use within their organisations. I think the value of attending these is so high that it is company policy for everyone at The Data Studio to attend (funnily enough I haven&#8217;t had any objection from anyone about this policy!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to present at some of the previous conferences and I thought I&#8217;d see if I might speak this year on something we feel often gets overlooked: Tableau Server.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/On_Her_Majestys_Secret_Server_Cover_copy.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-3101 aligncenter" title="Secret Server" src="http://www.interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Secret-Server1-209x300.png" alt="" width="167" height="240" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Click the image!</p>
<p>I often think that if Tableau Desktop is the lead singer of the band (all the glory, the oohs and aahs), Tableau Server is like all the rest of the band (quietly doing all the work of pulling it all together and making it glorious).</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d at least have some fun with making a poster for the application. Here it is for your amusement too. Click on the image for a large version to see the hidden jokes.</p>
<p>I hope I get to meet some of you in Barcelona.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few phrases I find cropping up regularly in the office that I think are useful and I&#8217;d like to share with you:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Great answers breed even better questions&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This is the power of iterative analytics; the results of the analytical process provokes more refined, more targeted questions from the users. I *love* this stage, when the person whose data it is sees something in the data they never saw before and that prompts an even better question to go and make the data answer. Absolutely fascinating and rewarding to witness, every time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You design. We build&#8221;</span></p>
<p>You <em>may</em> not believe this, but not everybody revels in the prospect of playing with data all day every day. That means that there will be plenty of times when you&#8217;re designing visualisations for other people, using their data to provide insight, helping to answer their questions. In these situations it is useful to think of the exercise in the above terms. The design of the dashboard must be theirs. They will let you know how their data is most likely to make sense to them. Your role is to offer some guidance or show alternatives but never to dictate the result. If they have designed it, they will understand it, own it, use it and value it. Isn&#8217;t that what you want too?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Easy is hard&#8221;</span></p>
<p>I take no credit for this one. Pat Hanrahan of Tableau used it in one of his presentations and I like it for two reasons. Firstly, it&#8217;s almost self referencing. Try and think of three little words that resonate with meaning (thank you, I love you too!). Secondly, and more importantly, it captures neatly one of the technical challenges of data visualisation, that of burying and hiding all the hard work of data wrangling, manipulation, calculated fields, blends, ETL processes etc so that all that remains is light, simple and accessible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody blogs about failure, right? In meetings and during training sessions I often talk about both failure and success. Specifically, I often mention my definition of dashboard failure which is if the user asks:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I download this data into Excel?&#8221;</p>
<p>This will, of course, happen but your role as a designer is to identify what the question is that the dashboard has provoked (good) but left unanswered (baaaaad). By coaxing out of the user(s) of the dashboard what it is that they would want to do with that data in Excel you take yourself a step closer to a complete, rounded dashboard that:<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> gives insight into a clearly defined question,<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> has a flow that mirrors the likely flow of questions, and (critically)<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">+</span> provides the data that allows the user to answer any questions that the dashboard has itself raised without any subsequent rework.</p>
<p>Keep going until no-one asks for or needs Excel. Keep succeeding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the recent Tableau Customer Conference (more on this later) one of the many excellent sessions I sat in on was Tips and Tricks From The Wild.</p>
<p>Last up was the Tableau jedi, Joe Mako (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/joemako" target="_blank">@joemako</a> or on<a href="https://plus.google.com/112115806334864192512/posts" target="_blank"> Google+</a>). Within the Tableau community Joe is famed and respected for his ability to see straight to the heart of a problem and work out the shortest route to it. When, at the very end of his session someone (I think it was Tom Brown &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/_tombrown_" target="_blank">@_tombrown_</a> also on <a href="https://plus.google.com/108296725383510328518" target="_blank">Google+</a>) asked him how did he this I was intrigued to hear what Joe would say.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/joemako/status/127549616152510465" target="_blank">tweeted </a>Joe&#8217;s great answer, Noah Iliinsky (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noahi" target="_blank">@noahi</a>) was kind enough to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noahi/status/127555315368599552" target="_blank">contribute </a>saying he would add &#8216;know your audience&#8217; to the list. I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>So here you have it. If you want to be quick and effective at delivering meaningful, accessible and above all <em>relevant</em> data for people just follow these four pointers.</p>
<ul>
<li>know your data structure</li>
<li>know what you want to achieve</li>
<li>know how to use Tableau</li>
<li>know your audience</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">We&#8217;re back from the UK Tableau User&#8217;s Group Meeting in London. Warmest thanks to Jen Stirrup, Andy Cotgreave, and Ian &amp; Jacqui Taylor of Flying Binary for organising such a successful event. It was great to see the number of Tableau users in the UK growing. The passion for Tableau remains as high as ever amongst all the fellow users we met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We&#8217;ve had a few requests for the workbooks we used in our presentation. These should be up on the <a href="http://www.uktug.com" target="_blank">UK TUG site</a> soon along with all the other presenter&#8217;s materials too &#8211; lots of good stuff!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Next up &#8211; Tableau&#8217;s coming to town! For two days Tableau will be in London showing off the amazing features of Tableau 6. We&#8217;ve been using it for a few months now and it&#8217;s got some amazing new features. If you can spare the time, it&#8217;ll definitely be worth going along. We&#8217;ll be there of course and we&#8217;re looking forward to meeting more of you Tableau users.</span></p>
