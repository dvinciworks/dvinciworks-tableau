				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have to make an important business trip that involves driving through heavy traffic. You jump into your brand new company car ready to set off, only to discover things are not what you expected. There is no steering wheel in front of you. The familiar pedals have gone too. In their place are some strange buttons and a small screen that can only display four letters. The traffic around you is building up and it&#8217;s time to get moving. Ready?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UCD-Interior-2-626x421.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10667" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UCD-Interior-2-626x421-300x201.jpg" alt="UCD-Interior-2-626x421" width="500" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>As a product manager back in the early 80&#8217;s I used to tell this story to illustrate the huge impact that new digital technology was having on the technicians who depended on their industrial measuring instruments to manage their production processes. Gone were the familiar switches and knobs. In their place, tortuous menus and confusing messages. Faced with the daily telephone calls from users struggling to ge their heads round all this new functionality I realised there had to be a better way to operate this technology and started to experiment. Making the complex simple proved to be a winning formula for this product line, and it&#8217;s a passion that guides me to this day.</p>
<p>It was exciting to be driving a new technology and good for my career too. As I began to work more closely with the commercial managers I was puzzled at first to find they did not really seem to share my enthusiasm for these wonderful products. Then I was hit by a blinding flash of the obvious. What they wanted to know is how this would help them reach their sales goals. I had to adjust my focus and start talking about the things that would help them achieve success. That was another key insight that sits deep.</p>
<p>My first experience to carry full P&amp;L responsibility for an organisation was a baptism by fire. I was asked to clean up the mess left by two failed General Managers before me just as Europe headed into a period of recession. Tough decisions were inevitable and I needed dependable data to help guide me. It was challenging to get all the insights that I needed and that&#8217;s when I really discovered the true loneliness of leadership and realised that each discipline within an organisation has its own unique language and way of thinking.</p>
<p>Hard work and enthusiasm are key to success, but not enough on their own. To reach the top of your game you really need good teamwork. Just like in sports that means each player needs to know what the game is and understand the rules. When I was given an the opportunity to build a new pan European operation for a manufacturer of infrared thermal systems I found we always performed best when we had good processes in place, supported with metrics that the teams owned.</p>
<p>In subsequent roles I continued to work on good processes, extending from services and operations into the more challenging areas of salesforce management. I found it hugely rewarding to see directly how the efforts of our teams were directly driving the sales successes. We found ways to track the take up of new offerings from the earliest introductions to customers, through lead generation and all the way along the pipeline to order conversion. My focus moved more and more into development of the metrics and tools &#8211; mainly using excel where I had to get my teeth into macro programming to achieve what I we needed.</p>
<p>My last role in the process automation field involved setting up a new service to help food producers optimise the operation of their production plant. As part of this I needed a way to display key metrics in an online portal. It was during this period I first worked with the team from Interworks and was introduced to Tableau. I fell in love with Tableau. How it took data and made it beautiful but moreover gave it meaning. Meaning that could be used to make decisions rather than the time spent pouring over numbers and a decision hurriedly being made on a best guess.</p>
<p>Working with InterWorks was an effortless experience. I was impressed by their professionalism and enthusiasm throughout the project, so much so that I joined their ranks in October 2013. Since then I have become the companies 7th Accredited Trainer, delivered training all over Europe and India and had the pleasure of working with a broad range of clients providing consultancy and proof of concepts. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed helping people professionally. To impart knowledge and see that person hit their potential is a great feeling. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;m a flying instructor in my free time and why InterWorks is the best place I can imagine being.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most data analysis is concerned with understanding what the data tells us &#8211; for example understanding if business is growing or not and discovering how sales are developing in different territories or across product lines.</p>
<p>But sometimes the story the data is <em>not</em> telling can be of vital interest. If a customer has stopped ordering how would you know &#8211; and how long would it take you to find out?</p>
<p>The chart below is designed to answer this question. It allows the user to see which customers have not placed orders recently and a slider control allows the user to define how many months &#8220;recently&#8221; means.</p>
<p><script type='text/javascript' src='http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script></p>
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 654px; height: 669px;'>
<noscript><br />
<a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;No&#47;Non-ActiveCustomer&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><br />
<object class='tableauViz' width='654' height='669' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F' /><param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Non-ActiveCustomer&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;No&#47;Non-ActiveCustomer&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' / ><param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>
<div style='width:654px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;'>
<div style='float:right; padding-right:8px;'>
<a href='http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/about-tableau-products?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Non-ActiveCustomer/Dashboard1' target='_blank'>Learn About Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<div class="shortcode-manager"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customers are sorted by the volume of sales placed before they stopped ordering and the user can select to pick how many to bring into the view by using a second slider control.</p>
<p>The challenge in designing this lies in the fact that datasets contain information on things that have happened and not on events that did not take place &#8211; in this case the orders a customer no longer placed.</p>
<p>To extract this information we have to find a work-around that lets us &#8220;read between the lines&#8221;. Here we look for the latest date that an order was placed and use a calculation to check if it falls earlier than our test date.</p>
<p>This example looks for customers that have stopped ordering, but the same approach can be used to discover other ways that inactivity may be a risk for business. Rather than looking at order dates you could choose to analyse contact activity from your customer relationship data. This could help discover if there are large accounts that have not been contacted recently or significant sales opportunities that need to be followed up.</p>
<p>How might an approach like this help you recognise trouble while there is still time to act?</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this please share them with us in the comments section.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Do I have a healthy pipeline of sales opportunities?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-29_09-49-181.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9835 alignright" alt="2014-01-29_09-49-18" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-29_09-49-181-300x212.png" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>Ensuring a healthy pipeline of opportunities is a key concern of any Sales Manager. In this post I would like to share with you a way of visualizing your pipeline that has proven highly valuable in practice. It is based on the method and terminology that Miller Heiman define in their Strategic Sel<span style="line-height: 1.5em">lin</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">g approach.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">They call this t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">he Sales Funnel – and that is the term I will use here.</span></p>
<p>Simplistically put, a sales funnel models the process of discovering potential sales opportunities, qualifying them to see if further selling effort makes sense and then doing the work needed to develop them into orders.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">Early prospecting and market research may uncover a wealth of opportunities where there may be potential to sell. These would typically be classified in our Universe until they have been investigated further. The following investigation, known as qualification, aims to find out if there is a real fit between the needs of the customer and the products and/or services on offer. It also aims to ascertain if this is a priority that is likely to be acted on in the short term. While this qualification effort is taking place the opportunity would be  placed Above the Funnel.</span></p>
<p>If qualification suggests that further sales effort is worthwhile then the opportunity would move In the Funnel. This is where most of the sales activity takes place: to identify the people that will influence the buying decision and seek alignment with their needs. As the selling efforts are concluded and the opportunity is close to order <span style="line-height: 1.5em">then it moves into the final stage: Best Few.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> A healthy funnel will have enough opportunities at each stage to fuel a steady stream of business that the selling organization can influence. So there are two key factors at play – the overall size of the funnel and its shape.</span>then it moves into the final stage: Best Few.</p>
<p>Traditional sales funnel charts visualise this as an actual funnel, where the width at each stage reflects the potential business volume. Unless the funnel is grossly out of shape it can be hard to see at a glance if a funnel is healthy or not. To make this possible you need a reference to show what a healthy funnel should look like. Also the visualisation needs to make comparison between the actual and reference funnels very easy to do at a glance.</p>
<p><script type='text/javascript' src='http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script>
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 604px; height: 469px;'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Sales Funnel ' src='http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;QX&#47;QXXYGWXMG&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz' width='604' height='469' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F' /><param name='path' value='shared&#47;QXXYGWXMG' / ><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;QX&#47;QXXYGWXMG&#47;1.png' / ><param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div>
<div style='width:604px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;'>

</div>
<div class="shortcode-manager"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visualisation developed using Tableau shows the health of the sales funnel at a glance. The solid colour bars show the actual value of opportunities at each stage of the selling process. The lighter bars show the size and shape of an ideal sales funnel. This ideal funnel is modelled on the opportunity to sales conversion rates and sales cycle times that are typical for the business in question.</p>
<p>Many users will be familiar with a tapered &#8220;Funnel Shaped&#8221; view. For comparison this type of layout is shown in the picture at the top of this post. Although there may be benefits in familiarity, this design carries two significant drawbacks. Firstly, the shaping does not reflect any meaningful information that might change over time. Secondly, the most valuable section of the funnel, Best Few, is actually shown with the smallest size and lowest position &#8211; hardly reflecting its real value.</p>
<p>Tableau allows this modelling and visualization to be done quickly and easily without complex programming or manipulation of graphics. Filters make it possible to drill down for higher detail – for example to see how the funnel for a specific product line or region is shaping up.</p>
<p>Looking at the shape of the funnel and recognizing where there are deviations from ideal allows a sales team to adjust the focus of their sales effort quickly and early to maintain a steady stream of business. This is a great example that shows how seeing the full picture can help you deliver consistently outstanding performance.</p>
