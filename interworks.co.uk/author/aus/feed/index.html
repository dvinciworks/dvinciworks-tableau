<p>So let’s fast forward the early bits. Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, worked for Fidelity Investments as an out of uni job blah blah. Then things started to get a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>I started a fledgling engineering business which quickly warped and twisted its way into a games console repair company. Fun. Anyone who has started a first business will know that you spend the first year just finding your feet. Learning about regulations you’ve never heard of before, wondering where the next day’s work is going to come from. I think it takes most people that long just to pop their heads up out the fog and take a look around and for me this was the point where I really started enjoying myself.</p>
<p>We had probably 6 or so employees, 5 repairers and a Quality Control/warehouse guy by this point. Even then I recognised the benefit to giving back the right information and feedback to staff as near to real time as possible. I had designed a simple data base and logging system and was using excel to query it a graph out the productivity. Nothing gave incentive to accurately log the repair like seeing your little bar in the chart jump above the guy next to you. At this point in the business it wasn’t even financially incentivised just good positive (quick) feedback. And that was the key.</p>
<p>The business doubled in size year on year and our graphing nudged its way into other areas of the business. Trying to get info out of emails we were receiving, desperately trying to get something better than the standard reporting out of SAGE Line 50 Accounts (reach out to me if you want to hear more about InterWorks solution with SAGE). With a workforce of 70+ we were spending a lot of time on it and had to come up with better quicker solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Access tables turned into SQL tables. Access forms turned into .NET. Excel graphs turned into Tableau Dashboards. Sold!</strong></p>
<p>From that point on Tableau has formed a big part of my life. For the remainder of the lifecycle of that business through to becoming a BI consultant and Tableau Trainer with InterWorks. I’m still using it and still enjoying using it.</p>
<p>So what now? Helping as many people as I can understand that access and insights to data matters. It’s not just for the CEO, not just for directors and managers but for everyone doing every job within an organisation. To even attempt this you have to have a tool which a lot of people can use and you have to open up the available data to many many more people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you ever wanted to know&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>“How far above the trend is that?”</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>“If I have a new client, what can I expect based on the current trend?”</strong></p>
<p>I have. InterWorks has clients who want to know and it crops up in many of my Tableau training classes.  I finally had some time to figure it out and thought I would share it so you too can do &#8216;What If&#8217; analysis based on the trend, or show how far above or below the trend a data point is (like in the view below).  It doesn&#8217;t look much but it hasn&#8217;t been possible before, it&#8217;s tough but <strong>REALLY</strong> useful.  Ready?</p>

</div>
<div class="shortcode-manager"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Tableau makes trend lines really easy to add (that&#8217;s the grey dotted line above).  It’s just a right click away. Most of the time simply visualising the trend line is the end goal so job done.  But if you want to &#8216;use&#8217; the trend line, interact with it and get real answers out you&#8217;re pretty stuck.  Hovering your mouse over the correct bit of the line and getting a confusing P value is not exactly useful, user friendly or slick. But there is a solution&#8230;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK this can get a little bit mathematical so I’ll keep it as light as I can.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – The Nasty Bit &#8211; Calculate the trend line in Tableau</strong></p>
<p>A linear progression (linear trend line) is based on the calculation:</p>
<p>y = αx + β            (Hover your mouse over the trend line above and you&#8217;ll see Tableau doing this calculation)</p>
<p>Where        α = (n∑(xy) -∑x ∑y) / (n∑x^2 -(∑x)^2 )        and              β = (∑y-α∑x) / n</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sorry about that bit.</strong> An example of this calculation is in the workbook but below is a brief explanation of how the annotation above can be written in Tableau calculated fields.</p>
<p>Generally speaking when you create a scatter plot in Tableau you are plotting SUM(X) against SUM(Y) rather than x against y. Just look at the Columns and Rows shelves to see this. So if we start to break the formula down then everywhere you see an x you are going to be using SUM(X) and y as SUM(Y). Hopefully you are with me so far.</p>
<p>The next step is to get the ∑x part which means the sum of x. This would be SUM( SUM(X) ) but this will throw up an error so for Tableau it can be written as WINDOW_SUM( SUM(X) ). This does bring us into table calc territory I’m afraid so later on we are going to have to consider what the ‘compute using’ is going to be or in other words what is the WINDOW that we are summing.</p>
<p>So parts like ∑x ∑y would be calculated in Tableau with</p>
<p>WINDOW_SUM( SUM(X) ) * WINDOW_SUM( SUM(Y) )</p>
<p>The other piece to the puzzle is what to use for the n in this equation. n stands for the number of data points which in Tableau becomes the calculated field SIZE(). So n∑(xy) becomes</p>
<p>SIZE() * WINDOW_SUM( SUM(X) * SUM(Y) )</p>
<p>Easy eh!!! I did say this is the nasty bit.</p>
<p>The way I have gone about this is by using a different calculation for each of the little elements of this equation.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CalculatedField.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10095" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CalculatedField-300x113.png" alt="CalculatedField" width="300" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>The only other thing to do which may be new to you is to set the Default Table Calculation. In my case to Country/Region but the important thing is to keep this consistent in all the calculations.  If you are going to be plotting customers then put in customers, if plotting products then compute using products etc. I have a data point for each Country/Region so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using. This is far more solid than &#8216;Compute using Table Across&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ComputeUsing.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10096" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ComputeUsing-300x213.png" alt="ComputeUsing" width="300" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>This is a really good habit to get into when writing table calculations in Tableau.</p>
<p>And here’s how it looks &#8211; Red line is my bit, dotted grey is Tableau&#8217;s. Snap.</p>
<p><script type='text/javascript' src='http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script>

</div>
<div class="shortcode-manager"></div>
<p>This has been created with a Dual axis chart of SUM(y) and Trend Line on the rows shelf. The only real purpose of this graph is to show that the figures match Tableau’s. No practical use as you could just turn on Tableau’s own trend line.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 – Practical applications</strong></p>
<p>Answering the question <strong>“how far above the trend is that”</strong></p>
<p>Now we’ve done the hard bit, calculating the difference is a pretty simple calculation of SUM(Y) – [Trend Line].</p>
<p>I’ve plotted this again as a dual axis using a Gantt bar to get the red line.  See chart at the top of this blog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answering the question <strong>“If I have a new client, what can I expect based on the current trend?”</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got this far then well done as this is the most useful bit!</p>
<p>To get a single figure for this question is not too hard, unfortunately visualising it is a bit tougher. The calculation works by using a parameter to allow the user to enter their own x value. Then we use a version of the trend line calculation to output the value for the y. Tableau doesn’t make it easy to add an imaginary data point to a viz so this view is a bit awkward to build. However, play around with the slider below and you&#8217;ll see that the square moves up and down the trend line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot of information buzzing about in the news at the moment about the growing levels of underemployment. It was a concept which was new to me but the more I read about it the more I realised that it is an extremely relevant topic in today&#8217;s economical climate.</p>
<p>It is all very well saying that levels of unemployment are actually falling at the moment but if those who make up these employment figures are not satisfied with the amount of work which is available to them and more importantly if they cannot survive on that level of income then the figures start looking increasing cloudy. It leads you to realise that underemployment figures are as valid and important as the more high profile employment figures.</p>
<p>So I decided to have a bit of a play with the numbers released by the ONS.</p>

<div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="width: 604px; height: 1095px;"><noscript><a href="#"><img alt=" " src="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Un&#47;Underemployment_1&#47;NavigationPage&#47;1_rss.png" style="border: none" /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" style="display: none;" width="604" height="1095"><param name="host_url" value="http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F" /><param name="site_root" value="" /><param name="name" value="Underemployment_1/NavigationPage" /><param name="tabs" value="yes" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /><param name="static_image" value="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Un/Underemployment_1/NavigationPage/1.png" /><param name="animate_transition" value="yes" /><param name="display_static_image" value="yes" /><param name="display_spinner" value="yes" /><param name="display_overlay" value="yes" /><param name="display_count" value="yes" /></object></div>

<p>The overview dashboard shows the stark growth of underemployment during the first wave of recession in 2008. I know that with the company I was running at the time the first thing to go was always the overtime which many of our staff relied on to some degree for their needed level of income. If overtime, or worse basic hours are cut then people will quickly slip from being employed to underemployed through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>The second dashboard shows how the current figures breakdown. The trend between those in full time and those in part time employment is hardly surprising. However the differences between the age brackets are very telling. The younger you are the more likely you are to be underempoyed. The 16-24 year olds being 22% underemployed against the over 65&#8217;s still in work only having 4% underemployed.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE FOR TABLEAU USERS</strong><br />
The bottom graph on the breakdown dashboard tries to show the percent underemployed for each age category plus giving the additional detail of the full/part time split. I really wanted to flip the axis so the stacked bar lines ran horizontal as I felt that made a lot more sense and would show that the postion of the stacked bar is actually the primary stat which is on display. However, try as I might I couldn&#8217;t get Tableau to do it. If anyone has any thoughts or solutions I&#8217;d love to hear them! (email aus@interworks.co.uk)</p>
<p>Lastly, my apologies for the lack of interactivity on the above visualisations&#8230;there wasn&#8217;t very much detail to the data!</p>

<p>However it is possible and below is an example of a menu system within a Tableau workbook which uses actions to navigate from sheet to sheet.<br />

<p>It is definitely a useful trick to know about but is a little bit fiddly to set up.</p>
<p>It is achieved by creating a series of sheets which will be used for navigation purposes. One will need to be created for each target dashboard plus an extra one for the return to main menu if you want. The example above has 4 dashboards so requires 5 separate sheets to create the navigation. Each sheet will then have its own filter action created from the worksheet menu to target the required dash. This can either be done as a select or menu link (both are used above).</p>
<p>The text itself is created through a simple calculated field with the string written inside and dropped onto the label shelf.</p>
<p>Create a menu dashboard to drop all the link worksheets onto, format to taste and you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>
<p>The example is very simple but there is no reason not to include some sort of metric onto each of the links (they are worksheets after all) then rather than simply a menu list it becomes a KPI overview with links to more detail if some target is reached and flagged.</p>
