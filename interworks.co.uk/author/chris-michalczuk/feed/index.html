<p>Tableau dashboards have allowed Medway Youth Trust to connect information from a number of different data sources, including management systems in schools and colleges. This data can then be used to map the path of young people from the age of 12, through to their late teens or early twenties. The charity analyses the data and can assess the risk each young person faces of becoming unemployed. This allows the charity to act fast and provide guidance, often before the youngster has left full time education.</p>
