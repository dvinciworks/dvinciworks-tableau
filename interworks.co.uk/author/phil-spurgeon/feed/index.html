<h2 style="color: #b30203;">InterWorks a Top Sponsor Again</h2>
<p style="color: #4d4d4d;">As a Tableau 8.2 Roadshow sponsor, InterWorks will be attending every European event. This continues InterWorks&#8217; long history of Tableau event sponsorship. Tableau will be showcasing 8.2&#8217;s fantastic new features and InterWorks will show you how to use them practically and efficiently. InterWorks&#8217; Business Intelligence Consultants have already mastered Tableau 8.2, and they&#8217;re ready and eager to assist attendees with all of their Tableau consulting and training needs.</p>
<h2 style="color: #b30203;">See Power Tools for Tableau in Action</h2>
<p style="color: #4d4d4d;">Tableau 8.2 is exciting in its own right, but InterWorks has a something extra to show event attendees: the revolutionary <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/" target="_blank">Power Tools for Tableau</a>. InterWorks first presented these tools at Tableau on Tour Conferences to eager and excited Tableau users from around Europe. We can&#8217;t wait to give even more of you the chance for a hands on demo of <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/tableau-workbooks/workbook-tools/" target="_blank">Workbook Tools for Tableau</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/tableau-workbooks/workbooksdk/" target="_blank">Workbook SDK for Tableau</a> at each event.</p>
<p style="color: #4d4d4d;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PowerToolsImage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PowerToolsImage.jpg" alt="PowerToolsImage" width="716" height="392" /></a></p>
<h2 style="color: #b30203;">Tableau Road Warriors</h2>
<p style="color: #4d4d4d;">InterWorks is no stranger to the road. We&#8217;ve previously joined Tableau on the <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="https://www.interworks.com/blogs/interworks-pr/2013/03/04/interworks-joins-tableau-cross-country-tableau-8-tour" target="_blank">Tableau 8 Tour</a>, the <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="https://www.interworks.com/blogs/jparnell/2013/11/11/tableau-interworks-announce-tableau-81-roadshow" target="_blank">Tableau 8.1 Roadshow</a> and the recent <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" title="InterWorks Blog - On the Road with Tableau" href="http://interworks.co.uk/business-intelligence/interworks-on-the-road-with-tableau/" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour Conferences</a> in Europe. We&#8217;ve even put on our own <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="http://tableauyourdata.com/" target="_blank">“Tableau Your Data!”</a> book tour across the U.S. <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" title="InterWorks Blog - EU Tableau Your Data Tour" href="http://interworks.co.uk/business-intelligence/interworks-brings-tableau-data-tour-europe/" target="_blank">and Europe</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #4d4d4d;">What’s the reason for all the travel? InterWorks looks for every opportunity to share our Tableau knowledge and enthusiasm. As the first <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="https://www.interworks.com/services/business-intelligence/tableau-gold-partner" target="_blank">Tableau Gold Partner</a> and a 2013 North American Tableau <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #ec2f00;" href="https://www.interworks.com/blogs/gsauls/2013/09/12/interworks-recognized-tableaus-north-american-partner-year" target="_blank">Partner of the Year</a>, we&#8217;re always on the front lines when it comes to improving the Tableau community. The Tableau 8.2 Roadshow is another chance to continue our mission of making the data world a better place.</p>

<p>It’s 24 days to go until the biggest Tableau event in Europe &#8211; <a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London</a>. If you’re a seasoned conference veteran you’ll know these events are huge. And this year is special because it was the first time the European event was split into three &#8211; The Hague, Munich and London. This gave the European Tableau community even more opportunity to share in the fun, the learning and the energy.</p>
<p>It’s by far the biggest and best opportunity for the Tableau community to come together to share their ideas, learn new ways of getting the very best from Tableau and enjoy all the fun that comes from being part of the most vibrant data analytics community in the world. There’s so much to do at the conferences it’s impossible not to come away feeling energised and brimming with new ideas of how to better implement Tableau in your role, getting those valuable insights that benefit your company end to end.</p>
<p>As a Gold Partner we live and breathe Tableau so the conferences are just as exciting for us as they are for you, so much so we&#8217;ve been working towards the London event since the start of the year.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ll be attending as sponsors and Tableau users, we thought we&#8217;d share some of the things we look forward to most about the Tableau Conferences:</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>As one would expect we use Tableau. A lot. And we&#8217;re lucky enough to work with a wide variety of clients from just about every industry there is so we&#8217;re not short of a few stories and lessons learned over the years. The conferences are the perfect places to share what we&#8217;ve learned, as well as pick up a new trick or two as well which we can then share with our clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S.jpg" alt="BoFwEp_CAAEAq1S" width="525" height="397" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Making Friends</strong></p>
<p>The Tableau conferences are a great place for new faces as well as old. The sense of shared bond and community is second to none and it’s one of the stand out parts of the event that we look forward to. The volume of new Tableau users each year never fails to amaze us and as some of our team have been to every single conference, we can vouch for how much the events have changed, grown and improved every single year. And that’s largely down to the amazing people we meet year after year.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10479 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GroupHug.jpg" alt="GroupHug" width="510" height="487" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uplifting Events</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest draws for the conferences is the keynote speeches and customer presentations. London this year is no exception with economist and broadcaster Tim Harford, and data editor of The Economist Kenneth Cukier in attendance alongside leading lights at Tableau Software.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10480 " src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Event.jpg" alt="Event" width="509" height="382" /></p>
<p>Our very own Dan Murray (InterWorks Director of BI Services and author of “<a title="Tableau Your Data" href="http://tableauyourdata.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Your Data!</a>”) will be presenting alongside Facebook’s Andy Kriebel on July 8th at 3pm, delivering a talk on how to set up and run a successful Tableau User Group. Dan and Andy go way back so you can expect a lively presentation that&#8217;ll be as much fun to watch as it will be to deliver. Not to mention hugely useful for the growing number of groups out there. Andy Kriebel is a <a title="Tableau Zen Masters" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2012/11/masters-teachers-innovators-meet-tableau-zen-masters-19799" target="_blank">Tableau Zen Master</a> and writes the hugely popular blog <a title="VizWiz" href="http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">VizWiz</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Tableau on Tour: London" href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/london/about" target="_blank">Tableau on Tour: London </a>is going to be a phenomenal event. With so many opportunities to learn the ways of Tableau, hear how Tableau has changed some of the biggest companies in the world and bond with your fellow users &#8211; the Tableau customer appreciation party is a must &#8211; it’ll no doubt be the first step towards you becoming a Tableau Jedi.</p>
<p>Make sure you visit our stand and say hi. The team will be there to answer any Tableau questions you may have, swap stories or you can check out a demo of the powerhouse of tools we have created: Power Tools for Tableau.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tableau has published a post on their own site detailing how the Heartbleed Vulnerability affects the Tableau software. Whilst the security updates were released last night we thought it better to share with you the details of the vulnerability with regards to Tableau so you can update passwords within your organisations as needed. This is taken directly from the <a title="Tableau Software" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com" target="_blank">Tableau Software</a> website:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>We have made Tableau versions 8.1.6 and 8.0.10 available. These are the maintenance releases which contain the correction for the Heartbleed vulnerability. The releases can be downloaded from either the <a href="http://myaccount.tableausoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">primary customer download center</a> or the <a href="https://licensing.tableausoftware.com/esdalt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alternate download site</a>. 8.0.10 is only on the alternate download site. Information and downloads are also available in our <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/support/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Release Notes</a>.<br />
</em><br />
By now you might have heard about the <a title="Heartbleed" href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heartbleed</a> vulnerability. Heartbleed is a critical security vulnerability in the OpenSSL software project. OpenSSL is an extremely popular open source software component used by a substantial number of applications and services running on the internet. Tableau is one of many products that include the OpenSSL component to manage the secure communication protocol. On April 7th, the OpenSSL Project released news of the vulnerability and an update to address it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to read client or server application memory. This can allow for encryption keys to be read which can enable the decrypting of data obtained by intercepting traffic. For example, passwords or other sensitive data could be accessed. Tableau’s desktop products use OpenSSL to negotiate the security protocol from the server to the desktop, including both Tableau Servers configured for SSL and Tableau Desktop products which communicate with other servers – for example a dashboard with a web page component embedded in it which may access a remote SSL server.</p>
<p>The Tableau product versions with this vulnerability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tableau Server version 8.0.6 thru 8.0.9 which are configured with SSL enabled. (Prior versions of Tableau Server are not vulnerable.)</li>
<li>Tableau Server version 8.1.0 thru 8.1.5 which are configured with SSL enabled.</li>
<li>Tableau Desktop versions 8.1.0 thru 8.1.5. All desktop varieties: Personal, Professional, Public Desktop, and Reader are vulnerable. (Prior versions of Tableau Desktop are not vulnerable).</li>
<li>The initial beta version of Tableau 8.2, both desktop and server.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently in final testing of updated Tableau versions that correct this vulnerability. We are creating new versions with the latest OpenSSL (version 1.0.1g) embedded. Our target is to have the software released for customers to download Thursday evening (April 10th). We will be releasing Tableau versions 8.0.10 and 8.1.6 to correct this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The rest of the Tableau properties do not have exposure to the Heartbleed vulnerability. Tableau Online, Tableau Public, the Tableau corporate website, customer portal, community forums, licensing server, map server, training content and other elements that are part of our website are all clear from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>We strongly encourage updating all affected Tableau product versions as soon as they are available, as this vulnerability poses a significant risk. Once your upgrade is complete, we recommend SSL certificates used on Tableau Server be updated as well as changing passwords on all Tableau Server accounts.</strong></p>
<p>We will announce availability of our updates via our social media channels, our <a title="Release Notes" href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/support/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Release Notes forum</a>, and an update to this blog post. With the release we will provide additional information about the changes and notes on performing the upgrade in a Knowledge Base article.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://tableau.secure.force.com/casesubmit?subject=OpenSSL+Questions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here</a> to contact our technical support organization if you have more questions or need additional guidance on performing the upgrade.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks is preparing for the biggest data visualization event in Europe to date: the Tableau Conference on Tour. Many are familiar with the European Tableau Customer Conference, which historically takes place in one location over the course of a week. This year, Tableau is opting to switch things up a bit. They’re taking their European conference on tour to three of Europe’s finest cities. Like the rabid Tableau fans we are, we’ll soon be packing our bags to join Tableau on this legendary tour.</p>
<h2><b>When and Where Will the Tour Take Place?</b></h2>
<p>The European leg of the tour is set for various dates between May and July. By splitting the European tour amongst three different cities, Tableau aims to give attendees a more relatable and focused experience based on the unique environment of each region. Below are the tour stops along with their respective dates:</p>
<p>19-21 May, 2014 | Den Haag, NL</p>
<p>26-28 May, 2014 | München, DE</p>
<p>7-9 July, 2014 | London, UK</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="http://ontour14.tableauconference.com/">official Tableau Conference on Tour website</a>.</p>
<p>Not able to make it? The Tableau Conference on Tour isn’t the only opportunity to see Tableau and InterWorks in action. We’ll also be at TCC14 in Seattle later this year. If you think the Tableau Conference on Tour is a big deal, just wait until we kick off the biggest Tableau party of the year at TCC14.</p>
<h2><b>InterWorks a Top Sponsor</b></h2>
<p>As a leading Tableau Gold Partner, we’re carrying on our tradition of sponsorship for yet another year. This means much more to us than buying a bit of advertising. It means we’ll be well represented at each event stop, standing ready to share our wealth of Tableau wisdom with attendees. We can’t wait to hear about all the exciting things people are doing with their data. We have a few surprises that you&#8217;ll just have to see for yourself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="InterWorks at TCCEU13" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u143/BMj4eFgCMAAs9lq.jpeg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Above: InterWorks presenting at TCCEU 2013.</em></p>
<h2>Get an Exclusive Look into Power Tools for Tableau</h2>
<p>We’re especially excited for the tour because it gives us the chance to show attendees our revolutionary Power Tools for Tableau. If you haven’t checked them out, head over to <a href="http://powertoolsfortableau.com/" target="_blank">the official Power Tools website</a> to get the down-low. Be sure to download the free demo of the Workbook SDK. We’ll be giving live demos of Power Tools at each event, so you won’t want to miss them!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks continues to experience incredible opportunities in the world of information technology, big data, business intelligence and development, allowing us to evolve into the global company we are today. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Our original branding has served us well over the years, but it&#8217;s time for a new brand that is the first step in our next phase of continued growth. So we present to you, the new look of InterWorks.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10145 aligncenter" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Logos_2014_IW_Identity_0.png" width="254" height="139" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>InterWorks Evolved</h2>
<p>Our new logo is indeed conceptual and meant to evoke a wide variety of responses. This effect is intentionally representative of the relationship we seek to hold with our clients. No two are the same.</p>
<p>Above all, InterWorks solves business and technical problems with our blend of talent, experience and partnerships. Our people are dedicated and determined, and take great pride in applying this recipe to your business in a way that is unique to each engagement. The average and the mediocre in business consulting is not our style and flies in the face of our core belief and biggest challenge. It&#8217;s a challenge that we all thoroughly enjoy, and we pledge to maintain our belief indefinitely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-07%20at%203.18.40%20PM.png" width="631" height="277" /></p>
<p>You see, our people love working here because they are challenged daily. No two days are the same. No two challenges are the same. No two <em>clients </em>are the same. And that&#8217;s what makes it great. They live very near the cutting edge and thrive on every opportunity to dig deep into their natural talents and past experiences to solve puzzles. We&#8217;re all a little bit Batman in that respect. Because our clients experience this excitement firsthand, often seeing results beyond their expectations, powerful relationships form between client and consultant. Such relationships are unequaled in other business and IT consulting firms.</p>
<p>This unique connection is the foundation of our organization and the inspiration for our new logo:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/puzzles_2.png" width="647" height="147" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our people, our experience, our partnerships – all work together to complete the foundation of your business.</p>
<h2>But yet, it’s so much more …</h2>
<p>We mentioned that our new logo is intentionally conceptual. The goal is to elicit an understanding according to the beholder’s experience with InterWorks. This means we aren&#8217;t satisfied with just a new logo.</p>
<p>Our use will typically be the primary logo found at the beginning of the article, but the identity plays out in many forms and expressions. We are excited to see this visual form grow over time as we apply the concept in other ways; from its origin in completed foundations, to obvious opportunities in building blocks, stair and interconnected network webs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.interworks.com/sites/default/files/u89/spiderweb_0.jpg" width="667" height="346" /></p>
<p>Simply put, the landscape for unique expressions of our original concept will be an endeavour all of its own over the coming years and we can&#8217;t wait to get stuck in. Speaking for the creative folks in our marketing department, we are ecstatic!</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>In addition to the rollout of our new logo across this website and all other InterWorks properties, along with a full overhaul of all print and traditional collateral, we are actively working on a new website. Our goal is not to simply re-skin the websites that you know today. Instead, we’re re-envisioning our company from the ground up and working to provide the right digital representation of who we have become and where we are going.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of the changes? </strong></em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterWorks EU is returning to the world’s largest IT exposition, CeBIT. InterWorks EU joins data visualization giant, Tableau Software to demonstrate the power of cutting-edge visual analysis in Tableau. Both InterWorks and Tableau will be at the ready to provide demos and answer any questions attendees may have surrounding Tableau consultancy and training.</p>
<p><strong>Another Landmark Year for Tableau, InterWorks</strong></p>
<p>Tableau has been nothing short of brilliant over the past year. The release of Tableau 8.1 has taken the software’s capabilities to soaring new heights. The highly-anticipated Tableau 8.2 is expected to continue this pattern. This excellence has not gone unnoticed. Gartner, a top technologic research firm, heralded Tableau as <i>the </i>BI and analytic<i> </i>leader in their 2014 “Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms”.</p>
