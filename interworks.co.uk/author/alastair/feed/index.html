				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>T-Minus 2 Days&#8230; (probably less if you read this before I update this countdown again!)</p>
<p>The Training Camps are almost complete and the tapering down is in progress&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Weigh-In is just around the corner which marks the Grand Finale in terms of preparations before the Main Event itself &#8211; &#8220;The Fight of the Century&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Click to open in new window" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/alastair.young#!/vizhome/MayweatherVsPacquiao-PathstotheFightoftheCentury/FightoftheCentury" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12261" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fight-of-the-Century-1024x812.png" alt="Fight of the Century" width="904" height="717" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">(Please click on the picture above to take you through to the live Dashboard hosted on Tableau Public)</h6>
<p>For 6+ years, boxing fans from across the globe have waited for this fight to happen. The endless and tedious, &#8216;Will-they Won&#8217;t-they&#8217; conundrum rattled on and on, far longer than anyone expected, and far longer than it ever should have. New discussions, new demands, purse agreements, drug testing, fight weight, glove weight&#8230;. All topics that in one way or another contributed to the fight not happening until now. With all this, the title of &#8216;The Best Pound-for-Pound Fighter in the World&#8217; is about to be decided either way and just to make it a little more interesting, let&#8217;s throw in the estimated $350 million in revenue it is likely to generate. It&#8217;s now quite easy to see why everyone is dubbing this &#8216;The Fight of the Century&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whoever wins &#8211; this has been the most hyped boxing match in recent years and rightly so. Neither fighter needs the money&#8230; but boxing as a sport needs this more than anything. Gone are days of the regular Big Fight Weekends.</p>
<p>Nothing will surprise its audience (apart from those at ringside whose pockets must feel considerably lighter). We all know each fighter&#8217;s capabilities, and are intrigued about both of their tactics going into the spectacle. Everyone has their favourite&#8230; it&#8217;s now just a case of who will WIN?</p>
<p>Mayweather is the supreme fighter with an unblemished professional record of 47-0-0 but&#8230; can he cope with Pacquiao&#8217;s speed? Can he take Pacquiao&#8217;s volume of punches? Can he continue to deal with the pressure of an undefeated record and the possibility of hitting the mat? &#8211; And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>Pacquiao in his own right is a phenomenal fighter. A sanctioned World Champion over 6 weight divisions throughout his career, but with some blemishes on 57-5-2 record. Have past defeats made him a better fighter? Can he play the long game against Mayweather? Can his speed and stance cause Mayweather to crumble? And is he past his prime?</p>
<p>With Mayweather currently favourite at odds of 1/2 and Pacquiao at odds of 2/1 to win outright, this is the closest and best odds for a Mayweather fight in recent years. Looking at the odds for an early stoppage (KO,TKO or DQ), Pacquiao is now favourite at 5/1 vs Mayweather at 13/2. This all may sound weird but this directly correlates to each of the fighter&#8217;s careers and how they have won their previous bouts. Mayweather stays for the long game but for Pacquiao it&#8217;s all about the knockouts.</p>
<p>Further information on each of the fighter&#8217;s professional careers can be found on the visualisation above. It provides historical fight data and statistics for each fighter in preparation for this weekend&#8217;s showdown. No matter what happens, it&#8217;s likely to be an amazing spectacle and hope it can live up to all its expectations.</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, I would love to see Manny Pacquiao knock out Floyd Mayweather &#8230;&#8230; underdogs can still win (remember Rahman beating Lennox Lewis!?)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the dust has FINALLY settled on this year&#8217;s RBS 6 Nations Championship. What started with a whimper almost 7 weeks ago in Cardiff, ended in what can only be described as an earth shattering explosion of top class Rugby on probably,* the best Super Saturday we are ever likely to see.</p>
<p>We were treated to monumental displays from all 6 sides, which broke no less that 15 records in the process, including a record points total of 221 points and 27 tries scored.</p>
<p>Wales, who considered to be rank outsiders for the title on the dawn of Super Saturday absolutely whitewashed Italy, to show that they really are a force to be reckoned with, and not only on paper.</p>
<p>Ireland, took Scotland apart in every aspect of the game, and showed no remorse as they equalled their biggest ever away win in the 6 Nations Championship.</p>
<p><em><strong>And&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p>England v France&#8230;. Wow &#8230; End to End Rugby! France finally showed some flair that seems to have been hidden from view for most of this years tournament; whilst England&#8217;s young back line fired on all cylinders, running in try after try &#8211; something that will no doubt give Stuart Lancaster nightmares when thinking about future selections.</p>
<p>A thrilling end to the championship resulted in Elation for Ireland, for winning back to back 6 Nations Championships, and gave some food for thought for the remaining teams.</p>
<p>Such a thrilling tournament gauges very well for the upcoming World Cup in the Autumn with England, Ireland and Wales all becoming contenders for the crown in their own right.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this Six Nations Visualisation, as being Irish &#8211; I definitely did!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week you heard from Kevin, talking about the <a href="http://interworks.co.uk/kevin-pemberton/new-user-interface-enhancements-tableau-desktop-9/">new user interface enhancements in Tableau Desktop 9</a>. Today, I will be introducing the new data connections that now come as standard within Tableau 9.0</p>
<p>In Tableau Desktop 9.0, there have been some fantastic UI improvements that Tableau have made which every user will notice as soon as they open up Tableau Desktop 9.0 for the first time. The updated UI welcomes its users in a slightly different way whereby the new home screen incorporates the Home screen and the Connect to Data screen from previous versions and presents it as one as shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">8.3                                                               9.0 Beta</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-10.32.12.png"><br />
</a><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/v8-v9-comp.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11164 size-large" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/v8-v9-comp-1024x442.png" alt="v8 v9 comp" width="904" height="390" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click the image to view bigger.</em></p>
<p>The ‘To a File’ and ‘To a server’ sections were originally only available in the Data Tab, and the ‘Saved Data Sources’ only available on the Home Tab in all of the most recent versions of Tableau Desktop. Tableau has now consolidated all these options into the Home screen for version 9.0 and thus immediately assists the user in navigation for data connections.<br />
Within this blog we will be giving you an overview of the new data types and server connections that are now supported by Tableau 9.0</p>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Connect To a File</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-11.00.45.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11145" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-11.00.45-213x300.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-23 at 11.00.45" width="213" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There are a number of distinct changes here that will be instantly picked up by almost every user of Desktop:</p>
<p>Firstly, the selection headers have been simplified. Microsoft Excel has now been named as only “Excel”, and likewise with Access. Tableau has also removed the ‘Tableau Data Extract’ selection header, although this is still an option within the ‘Other File Types header’. And finally, and probably, the most significant: a new header of ‘Stats File’ has been introduced.</p>
<p>Tableau have again listened intently to their end user requirements when it comes to data connection options, as the release of Tableau 9.0 has proved to be a significant jump forwards in supplying more connections, both from file as well as server based data sources. When comparing Tableau 8.3 vs 9.0, we can see very significant additions to the connect to a file options.</p>
<p>New connections are now available for the following file types.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;"> .sav</span></strong> &#8211; IBM SPSS file (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).<br />
Binary Format Dataset with Data dictionary.<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.sas7bdat</strong></span> &#8211; SAS data file (Statistical Analysis software).<br />
Binary Database Storage file. Common in Pharmaceutical Analysis<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.rda</strong></span> &#8211; R data file<br />
Created by older versions of R Statistical Programming Language<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.rdata</strong></span> &#8211; R data file<br />
Created by new versions of R..xlsb &#8211; optimised Excel file<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.cub</strong></span> &#8211; Local Cube file<br />
data files created and referenced by Analysis Services<br />
(was available within 8.3 for those that didnt know)<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.tsv</strong></span> &#8211; A tab-separated file.<br />
A simple text format for storing data in a tabular structure for databases or spreadsheets.<br />
&amp;<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>.tbm</strong></span> – Tableau Bookmark<br />
A snapshot of a Tableau worksheet. Contains data source and sheet layout information. Commonly used to transfer worksheets between Tableau Workbooks.</p>
<p>Although some of these options are closely related to already existing basic connectors, the addition of the .sav, .sas7bdat and the R source files are of greater interest. Connections to these data types are created under a new selection header of ‘Stats File’. The inclusion of such a header reinforces Tableau’s vision into enhancing its statistical capabilities and is a natural progression following the introduction of R in Tableau 8.1.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Connect To a server</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-11.41.52.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11154" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-11.41.52-120x300.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-23 at 11.41.52" width="162" height="405" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click the image to view bigger.</em></p>
<p>As expected, a new release of Tableau brings with it additional server connections. The list has been growing for a number of years with some minor releases also bringing in new connections which may or may not have been picked up by the end user.</p>
<p>New connections scheduled for Tableau 9.0 release are as follows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">MonetDB &#8211; An open source column-oriented DBMS<br />
Amazon EMR ** &#8211; Elastic MapReduce. Web service for data processing and analysis using Hadoop framework.<br />
Spark SQL ** &#8211; Open source processing engine for Big Data.<br />
** These are listed server connections within the 9.0.0 Beta release but are not providing function as yet.</p>
<p>Additional connectors which you may not have noticed in Tableau 8.3 are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">IBM Big Insight &#8211; Hadoop with Enterprise level features<br />
Marklogic &#8211; Enterprise level NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Database</p>
<p>Yet again, Tableau has delivered what its users want and increased the software capabilities by extending is connections.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>6 Nations Week 2</h2>
<p>Week two of the RBS 6 Nations Championship is now in the books. 3 excellent matches were scheduled over this past weekend, with the highlight expected to be the highly billed championship decider in Dublin between Ireland and England.</p>
<p><strong>Game Previews:</strong></p>
<p>The first match taking place on week 2 has the Scots hosting the Italians at Murrayfield.  The Scots, coming off a dismal second half performance against England in the Calcutta Cup in week 1, had revenge in mind after falling at the hands of the Italians last year in the Stadio Olimpico.  That subsequent defeat relegating Scotland to last place in the table and receiving the Wooden Spoon for their efforts.</p>
<p>The Second match of the weekend sees Wales travel to Paris to meet a French team in disarray.  With little possibility of winning the championship after both experiencing defeats in week 1, this game is about team rebuilding with a lot of pride at stake.  The Welsh, having not won a game in 8 consecutive outings need to get the monkey off their back if they want to return as a force to be reckoned with. As for the French, who didn&#8217;t really turn up in Rome, are out to show they are still one of the teams to beat&#8230;. as well as trying to quell any ideas that the French National Side is breaking at the seams after years of dominant performances.</p>
<p>Any real hopes of a Grand Slam in 2013 rest on a young English side, or a determined old school Irish side as we turn to Game 3.  Ireland return home to the Aviva Stadium after a good win against the Welsh last weekend in Cardiff. Hoping to build on this success, they are hoping to deny the travelling English a win yet again with the last England win in Dublin almost a decade ago.  England are hoping to take their game further with a young back line determined to make a statement of intent.  A keenly contested forward battle is expected with the match winner expecting to be crowned 6 nations champions come March.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All results can now be viewed within the updated Vizualisation. I have also added a results field and yellow card feature for all matches. Further Analysis to follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>6 Nations Week 1</h2>
<h3>Individual Game Scoring Analysis</h3>
<p>Welcome to my first ever Blog as part of InterWorks Europe.  It&#8217;s an exciting time here at InterWorks Europe which just so happens to coincide with the Annual 6 Nations Rugby Championship.  Rugby for me is a passion, being an avid Ulster and Ireland supporter, I thought how best to introduce myself to Tableau Interactive Dashboards and the start of my InterWorks Europe Blogging journey.</p>
<p>Rugby, as like any sport, has the normal array of statistics and data to supplement the post game scrutiny and subsequent win/loss diagnosis. Although these statistics are standard throughout the Rugby world,  they don&#8217;t really give us an opportunity to display the game visually without boring even the most obsessed fans.</p>
<p>I have, in part, taking this to task.  To try and make a number of data visualizations that are informative, interactive, and for the most part INTERESTING. Letting people know what happened in the game, Not just a Final Score and various percentages.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks and months as the 6 Nations Championship plays out before our eyes on the TV screens and packed Stadiums throughout Europe,  I will be dissecting the data from each and every match to bring updated and new visualizations to publish and post here on the InterWorks Europe  Blog.</p>
<p>2013 RBS 6 Nations Visualization 1.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">This first visualization shows the Scoring details within each of the three matches played over the opening weekend of the 2013 RBS 6 Nations.  Please select a Game from the &#8216;Matches Played&#8217; box.</h6>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">After selecting your game of choice, feel free to select or hover over the icons within the Scoring Information Table for Player and Points Scored Analysis.</h6>
