				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News UK is home to The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun news brands. With 72% of adults in Britain in touch with News UK’s titles, digital products and brand extensions, the business has developed quite a bit of interesting data. So, why Tableau? And why InterWorks? You’re about to find out.</p>
<p>We recently met with Keith Guthrie, Pulse Analytics Lead at News UK, to discuss the implementation of Tableau within one of Britain’s biggest newspaper companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsul.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-11545 aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsul.jpg" alt="newsul" width="394" height="263" /></a></p>
<p><b>Before we dive into Tableau was there a prior business problem within News UK to justify the search for a new tool?</b></p>
<p>When I joined the reporting team, Business Intelligence (BI) was relatively new to News UK, with the team only being set up in November 2013. As you can imagine prior to this, there wasn’t a great deal going on. In terms of the BI world, News UK had quite a fragmented environment. With the falling demand for printed products affecting the entire UK newspaper market and a focus on a paid-for digital content, we needed to support a more strategic digital strategy.</p>
<p><b>What were you hoping to get out of a BI strategy?</b></p>
<p>We have implemented a strategy to take the company on a journey to maximise our data assets. We want to fully understand our customers: who they are, what they do and what they are interested in, in order to help focus our efforts. In short, we needed to understand the best revenue streams and improve the uptake of print and digital subscriptions or hybrid product packs.</p>
<p><b>What systems were you using before you found Tableau?</b></p>
<p>Prior to Tableau, our regular reporting was a niche set of Excel reports. As with most big organisations, the tool sets used were vast, but the key delivery mechanism for both reporting and analytics was Excel. We are now moving into an environment where we use SAS for analytics and Tableau for reporting and data visualisation.</p>
<p><b>So (you knew we’d ask this), why Tableau?</b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why we picked Tableau. The team completed extensive research and knew the analytics market well. News UK already had a Tableau deployment, so it seemed a good choice, and all we needed was another server to keep things separate. We wanted self-sufficiency and speed of implementation – both of which Tableau really delivered on.</p>
<p><b>What impressed you about Tableau?</b></p>
<p>Well, that’s easy. As I’ve already mentioned, the first was its speed of implementation. If we’d had selected another tool, we potentially wouldn’t be where we are today. Tableau also has strong visualisation capabilities. We are able to bring data – some of which we’d never seen before – to life quickly. Tableau also benefits from an incredibly easy interface. The whole team has picked up how to use it with little or no fuss.</p>
<p><b>Do you have a fixed infrastructure that supports News UK BI?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, but we are working on it. We have a data warehouse with a single customer view, but there are multiple repositories for customer and subscription data (eg. Finance has one, marketing has one, etc.). Tableau does allow us to integrate this data into a single view, but we need to extract all the information before doing this – and moving data around is pretty expensive. We’re getting there though, one step at a time.</p>
<p><b>What areas of the business are using it?</b></p>
<p>At the moment, BI is one of the only areas of the business that creates dashboards using Tableau. We use it to build reports for all areas of the business, including Finance (for subscription management), Marketing (for who’s reading or viewing what) and for the Editorial team. I’m cautious about giving full control of Tableau to other areas of the business, but once we have implemented our new data warehouse we will investigate further self-serve options.</p>
<p><b>What’s your favourite thing about Tableau?</b></p>
<p>I’ve only been in the team for six months and was asked to deliver an effective BI solution. Without Tableau, it would’ve been incredibly difficult to get to where we currently are and in such a short time. So, my favourite thing is that Tableau helps us deliver quick wins. Before we used the tool, reporting proved very hard to do as we didn’t have a stable data asset and we had to do ad-hoc bits and pieces to keep our stakeholders happy. Tableau allows us access to different data sources, with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p><b>Let’s talk about InterWorks. How did we help?</b></p>
<p>We were a little different in our approach to training. Firstly, I dislike classroom training – it’s a little boring and rarely relevant to real-life scenarios. Also, we all had a relatively good understanding of the tools out there and how to use them, so adopted the ‘have a play, use the training videos and see what we can find’ approach. To be honest, it worked quite well.</p>
<p>There were, however, a few things we couldn’t quite grasp and we asked Rob from InterWorks to troubleshoot all of our queries. He provided examples of best practice and even helped us deliver three-to-four projects in our two-day workshop. Four months later, we called upon you guys again as we needed help with geomapping and getting things pixel perfect.</p>
<p><b>What’s next for News UK and Tableau?</b></p>
<p>We’re trying to evolve the use of Tableau. We aspire to create 30 reports that everyone uses, rather than creating numerous separate reports for the different departments. At the moment, our focus is on migrating reports from Excel into Tableau, moving data sources and enhancing what we’ve got. In a year’s time, I aim for the entire company to be able to self-serve using Tableau.</p>

<h3>Having difficulty unlocking the true potential of Tableau?</h3>
<p>Do you spend minutes/hours staring at the screen and thinking, &#8220;this should be easier than it is&#8221; or &#8220;how do I do this?!&#8221;, well you&#8217;re not alone. Tableau in its own right is an awesome piece of software, however, there can be moments when we all get a blank or we&#8217;re simply yet to uncover a certain feature that might make our data lives easier. This is why we introduced the Expert Hotline for Tableau.</p>
<p>If you need immediate answers, or have deadlines approaching fast and haven&#8217;t got time, or the need for a full day&#8217;s consultancy; why not book one of our Tableau certified consultants out for as little as 15 minutes? Our team are constantly available to help answer any data, or Tableau question you may have. Sync in with our calendars and find a time most suitable for you and get next to immediate help for as little as £35.</p>
<p><strong>An idea of the questions we can help with&#8230;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure how to get my data in right state for Tableau.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to create the best report for my deadline.</li>
<li>How do I improve the performance of my dashboard?</li>
<li>My work looks okay but I want it to &#8216;wow&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great to simply call a Tableau expert, start a screen share session and, as you talk to the screen, the solution appears for you? Well now you can, find out more here: www.interworks.co.uk/support</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.caravanclub.co.uk/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-11440 aligncenter" src="http://interworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/caraclub.jpg" alt="caraclub" width="408" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>Established in 1907, the Caravan Club was founded by ten men and one woman and is one of the few organisations that has maintained its same titles and goals since it first opened its doors. Now, over a hundred years later, the Caravan Club is the largest caravanning organisation in Europe.  With over 3,000 sites, accommodating 200,000 people every single day, it provides over 20 million bed nights per annum; more than any other major hotel chain.</p>
<p>When thinking about data, you can imagine 108 years building up to quite a significant amount. The Club was having difficulties uncovering the true potential of this data and, realising there had been significant developments in Business Analytics tooling, they found Tableau and wanted to gain business benefits by leveraging the software.</p>
<p>We recently met with John Quinlan, Business Analytics Manager, from the Caravan Club to find out how they’ve found Tableau:</p>
<p><strong>Hi John, would you mind telling us, what was your Business Problem or what were you trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>Sure! Essentially, the Club had an ageing SAP BW Installation, which had a limited scope of data in it. This wasn&#8217;t the easiest to develop in, and was costly to maintain. We also realised there had been significant developments in Business Analytics tooling and wanted to gain business benefit by leveraging these.</p>
<p><strong>Was there a driving factor in looking for a solution? </strong></p>
<p>The key driving factor in looking for another solution was that the Club wanted to migrate to a Business-led self-service BI organisational model. The existing SAP BW platform was complex and costly to maintain and only IS staff could perform report development. There were no real graphical capabilities; everything was exported to Excel and performed there.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you end up choosing InterWorks?</strong></p>
<p>InterWorks were the largest Tableau European Systems Integrator that we could find. There was a Vendor selection process evaluating systems integrators and products and InterWorks produced by far the best presentation and capabilities display.</p>
<p><strong>What was the InterWorks Solution?</strong></p>
<p>The Interworks options presented were discussed as to the best route for the Club. Initially it was decided to start with a “per user” approach to the licensing. This gave us the flexibility within the Club to roll out in a phased approach.</p>
<p><strong>How was the solution implemented?</strong></p>
<p>The solution implemented was led by a contracted project manager on behalf of the Club. They worked with our internal staff, InterWorks and the PM to refine the final architecture design and then implement it. InterWorks&#8217; experience in key areas such as installation of Tableau Server and initial report development, along with technical training was a significant benefit and one of the main reasons we chose them.</p>
<p><strong>What were the results?</strong></p>
<p>The results have delivered a trusted, stable solution with trained users and IS team members supporting where needed. The system is well liked and we have had to purchase more user licenses as the popularity continues to grow. New insights have been derived and many processes that took hours or days now can be performed in a matter of a few clicks.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of the key benefits the solutions provided?</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of having a system which is now a trusted single source of truth across the business has reduced the amount of reconciliation and disagreement between departments as to what the correct figures are, insights into behaviour from data spanning several sources is now possible and all this can be done by users and power users in the organisation resulting in a significantly lighter load on the IS resources and removing that bottleneck.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for the Caravan Club?</strong></p>
<p>The Club are now looking at further expansion of data and deeper integration with their Digital Engagement Platform to help drive decisions on campaign management and produce an all-inclusive single view of the customer.</p>
<p>We’re hoping the Caravan Club will continue to benefit from the many benefits Tableau brings and we’ll always be on hand to help, whenever needed.
